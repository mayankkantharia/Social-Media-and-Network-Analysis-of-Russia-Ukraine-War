> 
>   У Харкові мобілізований військовий відкрив вогонь з пневматичного пістолета по підлітках, які нібито називали його ТЦКівцем.
> 
> Про це [йдеться](https://reyestr.court.gov.ua/Review/127424171) у вироку Салтівського районного суду Харкова від 19 травня 2025 року.
> 
> Інцидент стався у березні цього року. Згідно з матеріалами справи, чоловік поїхав до сестри святкувати 8 Березня. Там він з сестрою вживав алкогольні напої. Коли випивки забракло, чоловік пішов до магазину купити ще. Там він зустрів свого друга.
> 
> На вулиці військовий бачив, що неподалік від них стояли двоє підлітків. Він не зрозумів, що вони неповнолітні, вони йому здавалися дорослими. Він почув, що ці хлопці хіхікають — подумав, що вони насміхаються з нього, на що він їм зробив зауваження. Проте хлопці не відреагували. Потім на свою адресу він почув слово «ТЦК» від цих юнаків. Позаяк чоловік був у формі, хлопці назвали його «ТЦКашником», що для нього було образливо.
> 
> «Оскільки він був у нетверезому стані, не повністю контролював свої дії, він дістав пістолет, спочатку зробив постріл у повітря, на що хлопці не відреагували, а лише почали сміятися. Тому він почав стріляти в різні боки», — йдеться в повідомленні.
> 
> Обвинувачений запевняє, що поцілити у хлопців у нього на меті не було. «Я в них не цілився, бо якби цілився, то влучив би, оскільки гарно стріляю», — сказав він.
> 
> Віськовослужбовець свою провину визнав повністю та пояснив, що оскільки був у нетверезому стані, не повністю контролював свої дії. Він додав, що бажає повернутися на службу, щоб продовжити захищати Батьківщину. Суд призначив чоловікові покарання у вигляді 3 років та 1 місяця позбавлення волі.

> 
> This is stated in the verdict of the Saltivskyi District Court of Kharkiv dated May 19, 2025.
> 
> The incident occurred in March of this year. According to the case materials, the man went to his sister’s place to celebrate International Women’s Day on March 8. There, he drank alcoholic beverages with his sister. When they ran out of alcohol, he went to a store to buy more, where he met a friend.
> 
> Outside, the soldier noticed two teenagers standing nearby. He did not realize they were minors—they seemed like adults to him. He heard the boys chuckling and assumed they were mocking him, so he confronted them. However, the boys did not react. Then he heard one of them say the word “TCC” directed at him. Since the man was in uniform, the boys called him a “TCCshnyk,” which he found offensive.
> 
> “Since he was intoxicated and not fully in control of his actions, he pulled out a pistol and first fired a shot into the air, which the boys ignored and instead started laughing. So he began shooting in various directions,” the document states.
> 
> The accused claims he had no intention of hitting the boys. “I wasn’t aiming at them—if I had been, I would have hit them, because I’m a good shot,” he said.
> 
> The serviceman fully admitted his guilt and explained that he was not entirely in control of his actions due to being drunk. He added that he wishes to return to service to continue defending the Homeland. The court sentenced the man to 3 years and 1 month of imprisonment.

>   
> [Image](https://russiaspivottoasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tartarstan-SEZ-1.jpg)_The Tatarstan SEZ near Kazan_The Russian Ministry of the Economy has been assessing the effectiveness of the 44 Special Economic Zones (SEZ) in the country, including their fiscal effectiveness. SEZs are attractive investments for foreign investors as they typically offer reduced corporate income tax rates – typically zero for the first three-five years and at a 50% discount for the next five, as well as discounts on worker welfare contributions and utility bills. As energy costs are already low in Russia, this can make an investment in a SEZ highly attractive. Tax rates and overheads can differ from zone to zone.
> 
> Other benefits – especially for SEZ situated near Russia’s borders, can be their bonded zones. These mean that component parts can be imported duty free into the SEZ and then married with Russian local components without import duty and VAT having to be paid during the final product manufacturing or assembly process. This saves cash flow. The finished product can then either be sold onto the Russian domestic market (at which point duties and VAT are levied onto the retail price) or reexported elsewhere (with no duty payable in Russia). As Russia is also a member of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) this means using a Russian SEZ to access markets within the EAEU can be financially attractive. The EAEU also includes Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and has free trade agreements with Iran, Serbia and Vietnam.
> 
> For financial comparisons and evaluation of Russia’s SEZ please contact us at [research at russiaspivottoasia.com](mailto:research at russiaspivottoasia.com)
> 
> The Ministry of Economics also examined Russia’s SEZ fiscal contributions as well. In doing so, it found that most were productive, with business models contributing a combined <a>₽</a>1.2 trillion (US$11.4 billion) to Russia’s GDP.
> 
> Of the 44 SEZs that were evaluated, 25 zones were considered fiscally effective, 18 achievably effective, with 1 ineffective, for which the management system has already been rebooted. The Ministry did not reveal which SEZs achieved these results.
> 
> Some adjustments to improve SEZ effective are being evaluated and are to be sent to the State Duma for passing into Russia’s SEZ laws. These include re-balancing the tax benefits for new investors to reflect differences in recognised R&D allowances as a capital contribution and the actual capitalisation.
> 
> Russia’s SEZs have also become increasingly popular with foreign investors over the past year. By the end of 2023, more than 1,000 resident companies were registered in the 44 SEZs, of which 176 were new investors, compared to 141 new investors in 2022.
> 
> During 2023, 18,100 new jobs were created, amounted to 169% of the planned budget, and up one and a half times higher than in 2022 at 12,000 jobs. Actual investments were also up at ₽660 billion (US$7.5 billion) in 2023 against ₽196 billion (US$2.3 billion) in 2022.
> 
> Russia’s SEZs have also been acquiring technology transfer know-how, itemised as an R&D contribution in investments, with this sector worth some ₽22 billion (US$250 million).
>

The SBU and the National Police detained 6 more arsonists who were carrying out orders from the Russian Federation in the north, east and south of Ukraine

The Security Service and the National Police detained six new accomplices of the Russian special services who were involved in setting fire to vehicles of the Defense Forces and Ukrzaliznytsia facilities.

According to the case materials, the Russian orders were carried out by local residents recruited by the FSB, the youngest of whom was 13 years old. All of them came into the sights of the occupiers when they were looking for “easy money” in Telegram channels.

First, the suspects coordinated with the curators on potential ""targets,"" and then destroyed them using flammable mixtures.

🔹 Two minors from the city of Samar were detained in the Dnipropetrovsk region for burning several relay cabinets of signal installations that regulate train traffic.

They were later supposed to find and set fire to the official cars of the Ukrainian defenders. But the suspects did not have time to do this, as they were detained ""hot on the trail"" after the crimes on the railway.

🔹 Three more FSB henchmen were detained in the Odessa region. They turned out to be two young men from the regional center, aged 17 and 18, as well as a 27-year-old resident of Chornomorsk, who were separately carrying out orders from the Russian Federation.

According to the case materials, the attackers destroyed three Ukrzaliznytsia relay cabinets and an SUV of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which was undergoing maintenance after completing tasks at the front.

🔹 A 24-year-old welder from a local service station was detained in Chernihiv for trying to burn a Ukrainian soldier's car.

According to the case materials, he wanted to set fire to a vehicle right on the territory of the service station, pretending that it was done by ""outsiders"" who had sneaked into the territory in the dark.

SBU officers acted proactively and detained the perpetrator when he had already prepared a flammable substance for the crime.

Based on all the facts revealed, the detainees were informed of suspicion in accordance with the crimes committed under two articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine:

▪ Part 2 of Article 113 (sabotage committed under martial law);
▪ Part 1 of Article 114-1 (obstruction of the lawful activities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations during martial law).
The perpetrators are in custody. The issue of bringing the 13-year-old suspect to justice is being decided.

Comprehensive measures were carried out by SBU officers in Dnipropetrovsk, Odessa, and Chernihiv regions together with the National Police under the procedural guidance of regional prosecutors' offices.
