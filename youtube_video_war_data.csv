Speaking with talks between Russia and Ukraine underway in Istanbul, Clarke said: ""Compared to 2022, the Russians are in a far worse position now than they were then because in 2022, they thought, 'it's only a matter of time before we take the whole country'. ""

lNOpwpzpvCk,Ukraine war: Putin no show at peace talks in Turkey,"The talks in Turkey were supposed to involve the presidents of Ukraine, Russia and possibly the USA. And they were supposed to usher in peace, or at least a ceasefire. Instead, Russia sent some low level officials while Vladimir Putin remained very much at home.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has travelled to Turkey but dismissed the Russian delegation as merely ""decorative"".  The Russian foreign ministry in turn called him a 'loser and a clown'.

FhSgx_IoQ-Y,Satellite images show Putin massing Russian troops on border with Finland,"Satellite images show Putin building up a substantial military presence on the Finnish border.

Images obtained by Swedish broadcaster SVT show four locations have seen a significant increase in activity.

NATO member Finland heavily protects its eastern border.

In 2022, a border fence was erected to provide more defence against a Russian invasion.

Following Finland’s accession to NATO, Kremlin officials threatened ‘military-technical response measures’.

This move shows a worrying war stance being adopted by Putin on Russia’s north-east border.

https://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1 - SUBSCRIBE TO US!
The aggressor country is urgently changing its plans regarding propaganda events timed to coincide with May 9. Following the massive attack by Ukrainian drones on Russian territory, a wave of cancellations of events planned for the said date has begun in the Russian Federation,  Verstka  writes . The restrictions affected at least Moscow, the Moscow region, the Vladimir, Lipetsk, Vologda regions and Mordovia. Thus, in Yegoryevsk, the memorial service for the victims was moved from the cemetery to the church ""for safety reasons."" In Ramenskoye, a school performance was cancelled, and in the Pavlovsky Posad District, evening concerts were cancelled, while car rallies and flower-laying ceremonies were retained. In the Vladimir region, the Immortal Regiment march and an evening concert have been cancelled in Kirzhach due to the ""threat of a UAV crash"". Similar measures have been taken in the Lipetsk region, where events have been postponed indefinitely and some events have been transferred to an online format. In Mordovia, the gala concert has been postponed to May 15 – officially due to ""Internet restrictions."" In the Vologda Region, bad weather was cited as the reason for postponing the events. In addition, performances by Russian artists who were unable to fly out of the Russian capital due to flight delays are being cancelled. 

Recall, Russia’s Defense Ministry has claimed its air defenses destroyed about 524 Ukrainian drones in a single day during what it called the most massive drone attack to date. The figure came after pro-war Russian military bloggers reported a record drone and missile assault on Russia overnight into May 7. The Z-affiliated Telegram channel Voevoda Veshchaet stated that 447 long-range drones and missiles had struck Russia between the evening of May 6 and early hours of May 7. The bloggers described it as the largest drone attack since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. During the night, Russian Telegram channels tracked swarms of drones headed toward Moscow via Ryazan, Tula and Oryol oblasts. Residents in the Moscow suburbs of Yegoryevsk and Kolomna reported hearing the sound of UAVs and explosions.

By morning, Russian airlines had begun mass cancellations and flight mergers, citing disruptions caused by the drone attacks.

Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine’s Center for Counteracting Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council, said a number of high-value targets within Russia’s military-industrial complex had been hit.

In Saransk, a fiber-optic systems plant was struck. In Tula, the attack targeted the Instrument Design Bureau. Another target was the Splav enterprise, a key developer of multiple launch rocket systems for the Russian military.

WEVwY3XkTrI,North Korea confirms it sent troops to fight for Russia in Ukraine war | BBC News,"North Korea has for the first time confirmed that it sent troops to fight for Russia against Ukraine.
 
In a report on state news agency KCNA, Pyongyang's military claimed its soldiers helped Russian forces ""completely liberate"" the Kursk border region, according to an order given by leader Kim Jong Un.

Western officials had earlier told the BBC they believed at least 1,000 of the 11,000 troops sent from North Korea had been killed over three months.

Putin Gives Stunning Answer On 'Reunifying' Ukrainian Parts Into Russia","Just days before the May 9 Victory Day parade, Russian President Vladimir Putin stuns the world by calling reconciliation with Ukraine “inevitable.” In a dramatic documentary interview, Putin blames the West for betrayal over the Minsk accords and claims the Ukraine war is nearing a “logical conclusion.” As Zelensky warns foreign leaders against visiting Moscow, Putin’s comments fuel speculation of a major shift. Is peace possible—or a bigger war coming?

6dUDjbvxpMA,"Russian drone attack on Ukraine bus kills nine, officials say | BBC News","Local officials say nine people have been killed in a Russian drone attack on a civilian bus in north-eastern Ukraine.

The Sumy regional military administration said four other people were injured in the town of Bilopillia on Saturday morning as the bus travelled to the regional capital Sumy, close to Russia's border. 

The reported attack comes just hours after Russia and Ukraine held their first direct peace talks since 2022 - no breakthrough was achieved, although a swap of prisoners of war was agreed. 

Ukraine's national police described the bus attack as a ""cynical war crime"". Russia has not commented directly but said it had hit a ""military staging area"" in Sumy.

xQao6l_y714,Ukraine Is Using Robot Attack Dogs Against Russia | War on Tape | Daily Mail,"It looks like something out of science fiction but is in fact terrifyingly real - a robot dog being used by the Ukrainians to help fight the Russians. The Khartiia Brigade, which considers itself a model unit for the future Ukrainian army, has employed the dog on combat missions as a scout, using it to navigate minefields and map enemy trenches. 

But this is just the beginning - already, some people are experimenting with attaching weapons to it, and integrating AI would allow the dog to identify and attack its own targets. Which begs the question: Is this the future of war? Allow War on Tape to explain.

k7WHP9UPq24,RUSSIA vs UKRAINE - 2 Years Later,"When Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine back in 2022, the world stood by in terror as the initial fear was that the capital Kyiv, and then the country, might fall in a matter of days. This was due to a variety of factors including a much smaller military, economy, and less advanced equipment than what the Russian military initially possessed. But Ukraine proved the world wrong. So, with all that has happened since then, how do Ukraine and Russia compare with each other now 2 years into this bloody conflict? Watch right now and find out!
