A day of reckoning would .The West was in a state of hoopla when Ukraine invaded Russian Kursk, not telling their subjects that this incursion into Russian territory was a flash in the pan, fireworks, for the lovers of colors and sounds to lift them out of their misery for a day or two.

The West, in tandem with the Ukranian Nazis, thought they had hanged Russia, and in fact the West cheered on the invasion, not realizing that “time was longer than the rope”.

They have a full Division plus 2 extra brigades parked in walking distance from Norway (plus 14th Army and lots and lots of naval and marine units in Murmansk per usual). They have a brigade dispatched to the central Finnish border, and around St Petersburg/the southern Finish border, everything is equally normal with the 6th Army. They are all reduced and thus smaller than during a happy spring day in 2019. Both Norway, Sweden and Finland is lifting off fighter jets to say hi to Russian fighters and bombers on a weekly basis. 

What is dramatic for British media does not pop up in media over here as it is daily life. 

Sure, there is a 5-year perspective on things, but that has always been daily life for more or less a century for everyone over here. Calm down. We will give a heads-up if we get worried. With lessons from Ukraine when Russia spent months to gather troops with absolutely no intention of attacking anyone (hehe) that heads up will come with months of time to prepare for our allies and NATO response forces. 

Russia setting up a few tent camps around us is hardly nothing to get an adrenaline rush from. Fact is that Russia has built these tent camps on and off for training purposes (and sometimes just as ""Potemkin cities"" for internal propaganda or to see if we pay attention) for decades.  

By 2030, we should obviously be ready to flex enough to make even less than rational Russian leaders to think ""no, we probably should not pretend to not be aggressive lying Russian bi*hes per normal"" - thus that work is ongoing with increasing speed all over the place. But again - totally without short term raised pulse rates.",3,2025-05-21T18:12:58Z
lW4h7aXNNR8,Russia reactivates Cold War bases - right on Nato's border,"Almost a million Russian personnel are estimated to have been killed, captured or wounded fighting in Ukraine and Kursk.

But despite those staggering losses, Russian president Vladimir Putin is still likely to have a bigger military when this conflict ends than when it began.

And there are indications that Moscow is already preparing its post-war posture, with signs that Russia is beefing up its military presence along its western border.

A British general and his American counterpart are sharing a bottle of Bordeaux. The Cold War hums quietly in the background.

The American says:
“Imagine a fairy shows up and offers you one wish — any strategic gain for the West. What would you choose?”

The Brit thinks for a moment.
“Only one?”

“Just one.”

The American grins and says:
“I’d wish for the Russians and the Ukrainians to wipe each other out. No need for us to get involved.”

The Brit nods slowly, then says with a faint smirk:
“Be reasonable, old chap. Fairies don’t grant absurd wishes.”

They both chuckle — and the bottle is nearly empty.

The US thought it was the global Hegemon and ruler, and learnt that no one can rule the planet, and every system and expansion has its limit- they should have listened to 25 years of Russian warnings- now they feel. The SMO is the only way to clarify this issue. War is always the ultimate conflict solver.
Russia fought Sweden for 21 years in 1700 until they, egged on by France and England saw that this was the end of their empire. They lost 1 Mio square kilometers.
The SMO is the only solution- and the quicker the Ukraine, Leinin's and Stalin's forced construct transformed into a Nazi state by the West is dissolved the better for all.",0,2025-05-21T12:02:13Z
