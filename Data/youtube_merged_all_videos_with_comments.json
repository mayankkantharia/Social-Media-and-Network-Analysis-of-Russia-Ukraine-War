Ukraine, in the meantime, desperately needs a ceasefire because it is losing and needs a pause to recover and regroup.\n\nRussia holds all the cards, and Ukraine badly needs a respite.\n\nRussian forces reportedly launched 112 strike drones, primarily of the \u201cGeran\u201d type, targeting Ukrainian infrastructure, including in Kyiv and Odesa. Ukrainian defenses struggled to repel the onslaught, losing another F-16 fighter jet in the process. The pilot ejected safely, but the incident highlights the growing strain on Ukraine\u2019s air capabilities.\n\nOn the frontlines, Ukrainian forces renewed attempts to breach Russian defenses in the Kursk region, deploying infantry, mobile units, and even boats to cross the Seym River. Russian troops repelled multiple incursions, destroying armored vehicles and thwarting sabotage groups disguised in Russian uniforms. However, Ukrainian rocket attacks inflicted damage on civilian infrastructure, including a hospital and a church in Tetkino, further escalating tensions.\n\nThe Russian offensive continued on Donbass frontlines, with the liberation of Volnoye Pole in the south and sustained pressure on key strongholds like Konstantinovka in the north. Russian victory in Torske near Krasny Liman further weakened Ukrainian positions, with reports indicating severe manpower shortages in defending Ukrainian units. \u00a0Russian forces, meanwhile, consolidated gains near Pokrovsk, threatening to envelop Ukrainian defenses along the Kazenny Torets River. Western analysts noted a cascading collapse of Ukrainian defenses in several directions, attributing Russian gains to relentless airstrikes and artillery barrages.\n\nThe juxtaposition of ongoing negotiations and escalating combat operations underscores the precarious nature of the conflict. While diplomats are trying to engage in dialogue, the battlefield realities suggest neither side is willing to cede ground without a fight. The coming days will reveal whether the talks in Istanbul can yield tangible de-escalation or if the war will continue to overshadow diplomatic efforts.\n\nThis war won't wait for diplomacy.",

Idiots here would be saying \"Russia can't win\" back then. Germany held territory inside France for the entire first world war. The front line never budged from the start until the end years later. For four years Germany was entrenched in France, never budging. They lost. The complete fools in the comment section would have been claiming German victory.\n\nMan power, industrial power, and morale wins wars. Russia have less man power, less economic power, and less morale than they did two years ago. In that time, Ukraine has become the world's military drone super power, producing more military drones than any other country, even the USA and China. Ukraine have also developed their own cruise missile capable of hitting as far into Russia as Moscow. What has Russia developed in that time? Nothing. Russia is fighting with the same military tech it started the war with. It started as a military super power vs a plucky underdog. It is now a military super power vs another military super power. Make no mistake, that's what Ukraine is currently.\n\nIf the European economy continues to back Ukraine, and there is no sign of it stopping, Russia has absolutely zero chance of winning this war. The only thing that could change that would be the USA or China joining Russia. Europe's economy dwarfs Russia's. People love to point out that Europe buys gas of Russia still. Russia's gas exports have dropped significantly every year since the war began.",

The Ukraine Army neutralized more than five thousand Russian tanks, and large numbers of their tank crews.\nRussia also keeps losing many air defense systems, and these are extremely hard to replace.\nToday Russia uses donkeys for Ukraine battlefront logistics, like in the First World War era.\nThe Russian economy - now in large part a war economy -  is in very bad shape and the Russian war against Ukraine is beginning to fail.\nBoth sides are suffering hideous losses but Ukraine will still be standing in five years, so what about the future of Russia?\nI expect the Russian Federation to fall down and break apart within five years, mainly due to economic collapse and regional nationalist movements.\nIn short, Ukraine loses a great deal but Russia loses everything.",

It's about PUTIN'S survival, but... who CARES! It's Putin's fault, it's the fault of a country that tolerated him so long--they've made their bed and will have to lie in it.

        "text": "Channel 4 you seems to not be able to understand that the international court still have a warrant for president putin, president zelensky knew that putin cannot show if turkey cannot guarantee putin's visit without arrest, therefore it quietly passes underneath the table.\nAlso ukraine still to day present have a decree issued by zelensky himself where ukraine banning all the direct negotiations with russia, untl russia leave don. regions from all military presence. EU is very aware that if putin enters in many UN nations or EU he will be arrested.\nSo we may all hate putin but at least EU should represent the news correctly and not miss crucial facts for why one doesn't appear on the table. Be a news outlet, not a speculation channel.\n\nThats like your ex wife standing outside your home calling the police while you both have restraining orders and beckoning you to come outside and approach her to violate yours first. XD News: this man is not serious about negotiating with his ex cuz he did not showed up. Really, thats your take?\n\nBetter news: Russia again didn't showed up for peace negotiation despite the international pressure for peace talks while IC refuses to take down the warrant issued for putin which complicates things for direct talks, unless both sides meet on neutral ground, but considering how many countries are involved in the conflict finding neutral ground for peace negotiations might prove difficult as neither side would sit on the table without security guarantees. And all of that while military actions continue on the territory of ukraine and thousands of ukranians are in fear of their life and still threatened to leave their homes, be evacuated, relocated or flee of fear for their life.",

Putin NEVER stated in his statement that he would be going in fact he categorically stated he would send  delegate to meet up with Ukrainian  delegates. He sent very much the same team as in 2022 back then nobody said Russia was not serious due to the team composition. Moreover negotiations are conducted this way before the principals meet to enact and sign the final face. Zelensky has acted like a brat nit a statement. He is such a fool who is being led by other fools  who should know better but their pathological hatred of Russia prevent them from thinking properly or analytically. Russia is winning the special military operation and will dictates the terms. If in 2022 Russia had declared WAR and not an SMO it would have taken them less than 4 weeks to utterly break Ukraine , think about that!",

Does anyone remember that the Neo NAZIS  that took the power in 2014 started attacking the Russian speaki population in east Ukraine. \n\nDoes anyone remember that Russia swiftly reacted an annexed Crimea the population of which is 80% ethnic Russian. \nDoes anyone remember the promise that Gorbachev was given by the USA that NATO wont expand towards Russian. \nDoes anyone remember when Putin asked Bill Clinton if Russia could join NATO since NATO was expanding eastwards. \nDoes anyone remember that Clinton replied that Russia can not join the defencive alliance NATO. \n\nI bet most of the people that read the above comment dont remember half of the above or have t heard any of the above. \nRussia hass been lied to so many times by the west that it was forced to take action to protect the Russian in Ukraine.  \nOver 10000 civilians of Russian decent were killed in Ukraine from 2014 till 2022",

Joining any military alliance comes with its advantages and disadvantages. One disadvantage is that you may end up with soldiers who have three years of combat experience stationed at your border, while an advantage is that NATO will respond \u2014 maybe. But Russia will not attack Finland, at least that\u2019s what I believe. I just think that Russia wants to strengthen its borders with NATO in case of any crisis, and by reinforcing the border, Russia aims to deter NATO from doing anything.

I see much of the same events and tatics being employed yet again with even more destruction and devastation following than the previous events. This will not end until Putin is forced to capitulate and the same for China who is waiting and watching to make their move. I pray I'm wrong, but I think not",

Today, it's that russia has experience in moder day combat. Drones, artillery, and other devastating weaponry.\nFinland has much less artillery, drones, and men. Today, it would be different if russia would invade in the summer. Not excessive snowfall and 10x more drones and artillery.

It is estimated that it will take about 3-5 years for Russia to get those bases back to full strenght.\nAlso Russia has based bombers close to Finland and do you know why? Not to plan attack Finland but because they are mostly safe there. It is dificult for Ukraine to attack those air bases this far. They run regularly sorties from those bases to Ukraine.",

After Chancellor Friedrich Merz's visit to Kyiv, he was therefore able to confirm: \"Germany will deliver. And we know exactly what and when. And we are satisfied.\" The former Ukrainian ambassador, Andriy Melnyk, had previously criticized Merz for the return to secrecy. \"This brings back bad memories of the time when the traffic light government tried to conceal a lack of military support in the spring of 2022 with secrecy,\" he said.",

Russian production of military equipment is not impressively large \"AS FOR THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CURRENT WAR, WHAT WE HAVE HERE AND NOW\". The Russian Federation does not function indefinitely. And that something is shown on propaganda television from Moscow, it is only shown, they are happy because they gave them hope, the reality is worse. The television theory and reality, it is really something completely different!!!!!!! The G7 countries provide greater possibilities for now. The BRICS countries are not able to produce the appropriate amount of military equipment for a specific time, on top of that they are technologically backward. Therefore, in any number of years the Russian Federation will definitely not win this war. There will be more and more war mercenaries. You Russians are dying unnecessarily. But this is already a certain, wrong ideological idea. Here, certain hunter schemes should come out in order to save a larger number of people. But this will not work in old or new Russia, so they die unnecessarily, gaining nothing for themselves, except only losses. As for the acquisition of a small area of \u200b\u200bUkrainian land in 3 years, where the number of dead Russian soldiers is slowly approaching 740,000. Your comrade Joseph Stalin made a record, he caused the deaths of 24,000,000 Russians in various circumstances. The Ukrainian land acquired for the Russian Federation will be almost imperceptible in comparison to the vastness of the largest country in the world, so one should think before the war (???). Except that this is Russia, so as always Russians must die in any large number with or without sense (???).",

    "title": "Russia urgently \"cancels May 9\" after massive Ukrainian drone attack",
    "description": "#Kanal13\u200b #likekanal13\u200b #subscribekanal13 #warinukraine\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1 - SUBSCRIBE TO US!\r\nThe aggressor country is urgently changing its plans regarding propaganda events timed to coincide with May 9. Following the massive attack by Ukrainian drones on Russian territory, a wave of cancellations of events planned for the said date has begun in the Russian Federation,  Verstka  writes . The restrictions affected at least Moscow, the Moscow region, the Vladimir, Lipetsk, Vologda regions and Mordovia. Thus, in Yegoryevsk, the memorial service for the victims was moved from the cemetery to the church \"for safety reasons.\" In Ramenskoye, a school performance was cancelled, and in the Pavlovsky Posad District, evening concerts were cancelled, while car rallies and flower-laying ceremonies were retained. In the Vladimir region, the Immortal Regiment march and an evening concert have been cancelled in Kirzhach due to the \"threat of a UAV crash\". Similar measures have been taken in the Lipetsk region, where events have been postponed indefinitely and some events have been transferred to an online format. In Mordovia, the gala concert has been postponed to May 15 \u2013 officially due to \"Internet restrictions.\" In the Vologda Region, bad weather was cited as the reason for postponing the events. In addition, performances by Russian artists who were unable to fly out of the Russian capital due to flight delays are being cancelled. \r\n\r\nRecall, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry has claimed its air defenses destroyed about 524 Ukrainian drones in a single day during what it called the most massive drone attack to date. The figure came after pro-war Russian military bloggers reported a record drone and missile assault on Russia overnight into May 7. The Z-affiliated Telegram channel Voevoda Veshchaet stated that 447 long-range drones and missiles had struck Russia between the evening of May 6 and early hours of May 7. The bloggers described it as the largest drone attack since the start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. During the night, Russian Telegram channels tracked swarms of drones headed toward Moscow via Ryazan, Tula and Oryol oblasts. Residents in the Moscow suburbs of Yegoryevsk and Kolomna reported hearing the sound of UAVs and explosions.\r\n\r\nBy morning, Russian airlines had begun mass cancellations and flight mergers, citing disruptions caused by the drone attacks.\r\n\r\nAndrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine\u2019s Center for Counteracting Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council, said a number of high-value targets within Russia\u2019s military-industrial complex had been hit.\r\n\r\nIn Saransk, a fiber-optic systems plant was struck. In Tula, the attack targeted the Instrument Design Bureau. Another target was the Splav enterprise, a key developer of multiple launch rocket systems for the Russian military.\r\nhttp://youtube.com/kanal13az/join - click here and support Kanal13 monthly for distributing more videos and independent journalism\r\n\r\nhttp://t.me/kanal13tv & https://bit.ly/37BVMqU \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1\r\nhttps://bit.ly/2Rs6MB3 \r\n#lastminutenewsfromukraine #kanal13ukraine  \r\nhttps://bit.ly/2V19Fdy\r\n\r\nClick here and just subscribe to Kanal13 - https://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/KANAL13AZ/join\r\n*ATTENTION: If you woul like to contact with US please, write to +49176 75077516 WhatsApp\r\n\r\n\u258c\u258c\u25baWebsite: http://kanal13.tv/\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/tvkanal13\r\nhttps://twitter.com/Kanal13Az\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/kanal13.az\r\n\r\nClick & Subscribe to the main youtube Channel\r\n\r\n\u00a9 KANAL13 [ Az\u0259rbaycan\u0131n ilk pe\u015f\u0259kar internet televiziyas\u0131 ] The First Internet TV of Azerbaijan\r\n\r\nTags: #Ukriane, #Russia, #Putin, #Putler, #Russian invasion of Ukraine, #Zelenski, #Kiev, #Kyiv, #Kadirov army, #Kadirov, #Kherson, #Bucha, #Kharkiv, #Ukrainian pilots, #vagners, #Russian tanks, #NATO, #drones, #Moscow, #Kreml, #war victims #Ukraina, News, The Washington Post, waPo Video, Washington Post Video, Washington Post YouTube, a:politics, aid, biden, putin, s:Politics, support, t:Other, Ukraine, war, fact check, news coverage, Donald Trump, news, wp video, forbes, nytimes, newspaper, media, journalism, Ilham Aliyev, Baku, Azerbaijan, Israel, Gaza, Palestine, Tel-Aviv, Garabag, Karabakh, football, ronaldo, messi, brian tyler cohen",

The Soviet Union was made up of 15 republics Ukraine all alone lost 15.7 million people that means that all the other fourteen republics including some shithole cesspool called Russia Lost, ALL TOGETHER  the other 7.3 million, For every American lost in World War Two in Europe 135 Ukrainians died churchill wrote that Germany was defeated in Ukraine by Ukrainians every square inch of Ukraine was occupied by the Nazis and it was the central stage of the entire Second World War in Europe second World War was decided in Ukraine ukrainians liberated all of the death camps in the east including Auschwitz and all of them. The truth about Ukraine will arise up out of the burial by Russian false narratives according to Ukraine ukraine will indeed destroy the Russian genocidal looting **** murdering torturing Russian filth that murdered 32 million Ukrainians in the 20th century alone. Ukraine will prevail Ukraine will have victory that's victory victory victory victory victory victory there i've said it because all of you **** cowards in all over the West will never use that word why not because you are cowards backstabbers hypocrites we ukrainians use the word victory and we will have victory over the Russian filth",

Trump's been faking it a lot lately, after he realized he stood out a bit 'one-sided' against Zelensky & Ukraine. Not surprisingly this theatre's PLANNED by Team Putin-Trump.. as the charade continues. Make no mistake.. Trump doesn't care about the war, people dying or any peace for that matter, and he definitely doesn't give a D*** about Ukraine! Trump just wants Russia to win the war so his best pal Putin can finally build him that Trump Tower in Moscow.. As you know, for Trump it's all about 'the deal' Then Donnie & Vladdie can score many more lucrative  deals.. such as stealing Ukraine's Rare Earth minerals.. splitting the profits - This is the Sad & Cold Hard Truth kids!

        "text": "A Plan for the USA and England to Stand Up to Global Threats\n\nHere\u2019s a detailed, down-to-earth plan for how the USA and England (as part of the UK) can team up to tackle big global adversaries like Russia, China, and North Korea. This isn\u2019t just about power\u2014it\u2019s about protecting people, supporting Ukraine, and making the world a safer place. We\u2019ll cover military moves, economic punches, and diplomatic teamwork, all while keeping it human and real.\n\n\n\nMilitary Strategies: Showing Strength, Protecting Lives\n\nThe USA and England have a long history of standing together when the going gets tough. Here\u2019s how they can flex their military might\u2014not to start fights, but to stop them before they spiral out of control:\n\n\n\n\n\nBacking Eastern Europe\nPicture families in places like Poland or Latvia, worried about Russia stirring trouble nearby. The USA and England can send more troops and top-notch missile defenses to Eastern Europe, working hand-in-hand with NATO. Joint training with local forces would be like a loud message to Russia: \u201cWe\u2019re here, we\u2019re united, and we\u2019re not messing around.\u201d\n\n\n\nArming Ukraine with What They Need\nUkraine\u2019s people are fighting for their homes\u2014think of the courage it takes to stand up to a giant like Russia. The USA and England can supply them with advanced weapons, like long-range missiles, to push back Russian forces. Sharing real-time intelligence would be like giving Ukraine a map to navigate the chaos, helping them protect their kids and communities.\n\n\n\nGetting Ukraine into NATO, Fast\nUkraine wants in on NATO, and why wouldn\u2019t they? It\u2019s like joining a big family that\u2019s got your back. The USA and England can lead the charge to speed this up, making it clear that if Russia attacks a NATO member, they\u2019re taking on the whole team. That\u2019s a line in the sand Putin won\u2019t want to cross.\n\n\n\nKeeping China in Line in the Indo-Pacific\nChina\u2019s been eyeing places like Taiwan, acting like they own the neighborhood. The USA and England can boost naval patrols and air support in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait, teaming up with allies like Japan and Australia. It\u2019s like keeping an eye on the street to make sure no one gets out of hand\u2014stronger together.\n\n\n\nStopping North Korea\u2019s Bluster\nNorth Korea keeps lobbing missiles like it\u2019s a game. The USA and England can work with South Korea and Japan, setting up better missile defenses\u2014like catching those missiles before they cause harm. Quiet cyber moves could also mess with North Korea\u2019s plans, like flipping off their lights when they least expect it.\n\n\n\nEconomic Strategies: Hitting the Wallet Hard\n\nMoney keeps these adversaries going, so the USA and England can use their economic clout to turn the tables. Here\u2019s how:\n\n\n\n\n\nCutting Russia\u2019s Cash Flow\nRussia\u2019s war depends on selling oil and gas. The USA and England can tighten sanctions to choke that off, making it harder for Putin to fund his aggression. They can also lean on countries like India or China, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re either with us or with him\u2014choose wisely.\u201d Kicking Russia out of global finance is like taking away their credit card.\n\n\n\nBreaking Europe\u2019s Reliance on Russian Gas\nImagine European families stuck in the cold because Russia controls their energy. The USA can ship more natural gas to Europe, while England pushes for wind and solar projects. It\u2019s like helping a friend grow their own food instead of begging from the enemy.\n\n\n\nPutting the Squeeze on China\nChina\u2019s been bending trade rules for years. The USA and England can hit them with tariffs and block their access to Western tech\u2014like telling them, \u201cPlay fair or sit out.\u201d Moving factories to friendly countries would create jobs elsewhere and loosen China\u2019s hold.\n\n\n\nKeeping North Korea Broke\nNorth Korea dodges sanctions like it\u2019s a sport. The USA and England can team up with allies to close those loopholes, especially with China, cutting off Kim\u2019s cash for weapons. No money, no missiles\u2014it\u2019s that simple.\n\n\n\nDiplomatic Strategies: Teaming Up to Win\n\nSometimes talking\u2014or not talking\u2014can be just as powerful as fighting. Here\u2019s how the USA and England can lead with smarts:\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxing Out Russia and China\nThink of Russia and China as the troublemakers everyone\u2019s tired of. The USA and England can pull together NATO, the EU, and allies like Japan and India to freeze them out. Sweetening the deal with trade or aid for countries like Brazil could peel them away from the bad guys\u2014it\u2019s like building a club no one wants to miss.\n\n\n\nCheering Ukraine On, Worldwide\nUkraine\u2019s fight is everyone\u2019s fight. The USA and England can rally the world to send more weapons, cash, and rebuilding help\u2014think of it as a global fundraiser for freedom. Pushing Europe to ditch Russian gas for good would keep the momentum going.\n\n\n\nHandling North Korea Carefully\nNorth Korea\u2019s tricky, like a wild card. The USA and England can keep quiet talks going, nudging Kim to drop his nukes, while piling on pressure with South Korea and Japan. It\u2019s a carrot-and-stick approach\u2014firm but open to change.\n\n\n\nLeading the World as a Team\nPicture Trump\u2014or any leader\u2014calling the shots like a coach, getting everyone on the same page. The USA and England can spearhead this, showing the world how to stand tall. It\u2019s not just about being tough\u2014it\u2019s about inspiring others to join in.\n\n\n\nUkraine and the World: One Big Fight\n\n\n\n\n\nUkraine\u2019s Role\nUkraine\u2019s the little engine that could, battling for their land and their lives. With the USA and England\u2019s help\u2014weapons, intel, NATO\u2014they can keep going. Every day they resist, they prove freedom\u2019s worth fighting for.\n\n\n\nThe World\u2019s Part\nThis isn\u2019t just Ukraine\u2019s war\u2014it\u2019s a wake-up call. The USA and England can get Europe, Asia, and beyond to crank up the pressure on Russia, China, and North Korea. Cut their money, stop their weapons, break their support\u2014it\u2019s like the whole world saying, \u201cWe\u2019re done with this.\u201d\n\n\n\nWrapping It Up: Tough, Smart, and Human\n\nThe USA and England have the muscle, the brains, and the heart to pull this off. It\u2019s not about starting wars\u2014it\u2019s about stopping them by arming Ukraine, hitting Russia and China where it hurts, and leading a world that\u2019s had enough of bullies. This is for the Ukrainian mom who just wants her kids safe, the European worker who needs heat in winter, the Asian kid who deserves a peaceful tomorrow. Together, they can make it happen\u2014and show the world what strength really looks like.",

We are ALL sinners - (Rom. 6:23) For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Sin separates us from the Holy God\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. There is a punishment for our sin -(Rom. 6:23a) For the wages of sin is death;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Death - eternal death - HELL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. God loves us, He does not want us to go to Hell, He provided a way for our escape from Hell - (Rom. 5:8) But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Because of God's love for us, He sent his only son Jesus Christ to die in our place on the cross. Jesus Christ took all the weight of our sins so we can be saved through grace, NOT our works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* The blood that Jesus shed on the cross can wash away our sins and make us clean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Through Jesus Christ, we can now have eternal life in HEAVEN - (Rom. 6:23b) but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Gift - free, but you can only have it if you receive it. If you reject it then the punishment of Hell is waiting for you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. How can I receive eternal life? - (Rom. 10:9) That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* You have to admit you are a sinner and you cannot save yourself from Hell nor go to Heaven through your own efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0You have to believe in your heart that Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins, was buried and rose again after 3 days and that He and only He can save you from hell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Roman 10:13) For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Whosoever means anyone including me and you!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to do it? Pray this prayer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear God, I admit I am a sinner and cannot save myself from hell. I believe that Jesus Christ died for my sins, was buried and rose again. I believe that only\u00a0 Jesus Christ can save me from Hell and He is the only way to Heaven.\u00a0 I accept Jesus Christ in my heart as my Lord and Savior. Thank You for eternal life. Amen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,",

Their advocates' complete denials have turned to downplaying.\n\nBy the way, your map is mislabelled: Russia annexed the Crimea in 2014, but it also annexed the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia Oblasti, as well as the Kinburn Spit of Mykolaiv Oblast, in 2022. The parts of Kharkiv and Sumy Oblasti Russian forces currently occupy are the only parts of the Russian-occupied Ukraine that the Russian Federation does _not_ claim as its _de jure_ territory. The Crimea is the only Ukrainian first-level administrative division that Russia _de facto_ wholly controls.",

The signature of the so-called Budapest Memorandum concluded arduous negotiations that resulted in Ukraine\u2019s agreement to relinquish the world\u2019s third-largest nuclear arsenal, which the country inherited from the collapsed Soviet Union, and transfer all nuclear warheads to Russia for dismantlement. The signatories of the memorandum pledged to respect Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and inviolability of its borders, and to refrain from the use or threat of military force. Russia breached these commitments with its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and aggression in eastern Ukraine, bringing the meaning and value of security assurance pledged in the Memorandum under renewed scrutiny.",

        "text": "Strategic Call for Global Cooperation to Strengthen Ukraine's Autonomous Defense Capabilities\nEsteemed Leaders, Innovators, and Partners,\n\nIn the face of ongoing global challenges and escalating hybrid threats, it is imperative to act decisively. One of the most impactful ways to support Ukraine today is by massively scaling the production and advancement of unmanned systems \u2014 drones, robotics, and AI- and AGI-driven missile technologies \u2014 in both volume and diversity of modifications. Machines must engage in warfare, while humans are preserved and protected.\n\nThis technological acceleration must primarily be rooted in Ukraine, while international cooperation should be established based on each country's strengths:\n\nThe United Kingdom's Rolls-Royce, a global leader in aerospace propulsion, could cooperate with Ukraine\u2019s Yuzhmash, renowned for its rocket and aerospace engineering capabilities, to jointly develop next-generation engines for aerospace and defense.\n\nJapan, a world leader in robotics, can build strategic partnerships with Ukrainian robotics manufacturers, enhancing both nations\u2019 capabilities through collaboration and joint development projects.\n\nGermany, with its premier robotics institutes, could provide research and engineering synergies with Ukraine\u2019s defense technology initiatives.\n\nThe United States, leading in Artificial Intelligence, particularly through institutions like DeepMind Robotics, is pioneering AGI \u2014 enabling AI systems to understand both natural language and computer vision while controlling robotic manipulators. These advances should be integrated into Ukraine\u2019s defense sector to achieve full autonomy in battlefield robotics.\n\nBy connecting Ukraine to such \"technological modules,\" a mutually beneficial exchange of expertise, technology, and real-world testing will be realized, catalyzing innovation on both sides.\n\nMoreover, the development of autonomous, intelligent swarms of drones and robotic systems capable of independent decision-making will drastically change the dynamics of modern defense. AI must be trained to coordinate diverse robotic platforms, enabling seamless and adaptive battlefield cooperation \u2014 learning through reinforcement to avoid past mistakes and improve over time.\n\nThis is the future that Ukraine, together with its allies, must build:\n\nA fully integrated, autonomous defense ecosystem based on collective strength, innovation, and unwavering strategic vision.\n\nUrgency is critical. China, Russia, and their allies are actively developing similar systems at high speed. This is not merely a technological race \u2014 it is a marathon of resilience and supremacy. We are already witnessing a \"new Cold War\" with increasingly \"hot\" elements, impacting the future global balance.\n\nDelays by Ukraine\u2019s allies will only provide China and Russia with greater opportunities to strengthen their positions.\nThe time to act boldly and cooperatively is now.\n\nTogether, through decisive innovation and strategic alliances, we can ensure that the future is protected by the forces of freedom, intelligence, and humanity.",

Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you. In your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. Do not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him.\r\nThis is how you should pray:\r\nOur Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,\r\nYour kingdom come; your will be done, on earth as in heaven,\r\nGive us today our daily bread,\r\nForgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.\r\nAnd do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one.\r\nFor yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, for ever.\r\nAmen.\r\nFor if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.\u201d \u2013 (The Prophet and Messiah Jesus of Nazareth at Matthew 6: 6-15) \u2013\r\n\r\n\u201cPass no judgement, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you.\u201d \u2013 (at Matthew 7: 1-2) \u2013\r\n\r\n\u201cIn truth I tell you, if anyone obeys my teaching he shall never know what it is to die.\u201d \u2013 (at John 8: 51) \u2013\r\n\r\n\u201cAlways treat others as you would like them to treat you: that is the Law and the Prophets.\r\nEnter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it.\u201d \u2013 (Matthew 7: 12-14) \u2013\r\n\r\n\u201cI am the gate; anyone who comes into the fold through me shall be safe. He shall go in and out and shall find pasturage.\r\nThe thief comes only to steal, to kill, to destroy; I have come that men may have life, and may have it in all its fullness.\u201d \u2013 (John 10: 9-10) \u2013\r\n\r\n\u201cBeware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves.\u201d \u2013 (Matthew 7: 15) \u2013\r\n\r\n\u201cNot everyone who says to me, \u2018Lord, Lord,\u2019 will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.\u201d \u2013 (Matthew 7: 21) \u2013\r\n\u201cI am the resurrection and I am life. If a man has faith in me, even though he dies, he shall come to life; and any one who is alive and has faith shall never die.\u201d \u2013 (John 11: 25-26) \u2013\r\n\r\n\u201cI have not come to judge the world, but to save the world\u201d \u2013 (John 12: 47) \u2013\r\n\u201cWhoever then will acknowledge me before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father in heaven; and whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.\u201d \u2013 (Matthew 10: 32-34) \u2013\r\n\r\n\u201cI am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me. If you knew me you would know my Father too.\u201d \u2013 (John 14: 6-7) \u2013\r\n\r\n\u201cAn expert in the law, [a leading religious Pharisee] tested him with this question: \u2018Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?\u2019 He answered, \u2018Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind. That is the greatest commandment. It comes first. The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. Everything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.\u2019\u201d \u2013 (Matthew 22: 35-40) \u2013\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.\u201d \u2013 (John 15: 13) \u2013\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not call any man on earth \u2018father\u2019 ; for you have one Father and he is in heaven. Nor must you be called \u2018teacher\u2019 ; you have one Teacher, the Messiah.\u201d \u2013 (Matthew 23: 9-10) \u2013\r\n\r\n\u201cTake care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name\u2026\u201d \u2013 (Matthew 24: 4) \u2013\r\n\u201cMany false prophets will arise, and will mislead many; and as lawlessness spreads, men\u2019s love for one another will grow cold. But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. \u201d \u2013 (Matthew 24: 11-13) \u2013 \r\n\r\n\u201cTeach them to observe all that I have commanded you. And be assured, I am with you always, to the end of time.\u201d \u2013 (Matthew 28: 20) \u2013\r\n\r\nYours, in true Spirit and in our one given prayer, 2gointruth, on Monday the28th of April 2025: \u2013 (Please read Matthew 5: 14-16) \u2013 Where every minute (of both day and night) can be a new beginning for any one of us.

Was sollte Russland denn tun zusehen wie die vom Westen aufger\u00fcstete und gesteuerte Ukraine milit\u00e4risch gegen die russischen Menschen im Donbass Donezk uuu vorgeht wie all die Jahre davor schon. Man hat ja in Odessa gesehen was mit unbewaffneten Russen im Haus der Gewerkschaft passiert ist weil sie gegen die Regierung welche mittels Putsch 2014 an die Macht kam in Kiew mithilfe der USA. Wo sind die Prozesse wegen Mordes geblieben!!!???? Oder auf der Krim die russische Bev\u00f6lkerung die dort seit Katarina der Gro\u00dfen lebt soll am besten freiwillig abhauen oder sie wird deportiert oder anderweitig entfernt wird wie es der Chef des ukrainischen Geheimdienstes erkl\u00e4rt hat sollte die Ukraine wieder \u00fcber die Krim die Kontrolle haben. Oder gar all die Aktionen von Ultra Rechten privaten milit\u00e4rischen Gruppen wie Asow uuu die nach Feststellung und Aussagen von Amnesty International (welche bestimmt keine Russland-Freunde sind) Kriegsverbrechen begangen haben in der Zeit von 2014-2020 in den \u00f6stlichen Gebieten der Ukraine die vorwiegend von Russen bewohnt worden. Wo ist die Strafrechts-Verfolgung dieser Taten. Aber nein diese Einheit wird hochgelobt und als Sondereinheit des Innerministerium eingegliedert. Wieso wird ein Mitl\u00e4ufer der Politik der Nazis Herr Banderas pl\u00f6tzlich als Held der Ukraine gesehen. Ist das die Art wie \"der Westen jetzt mit dem Gedankengut der Nationalsozialisten\" umgehen will. Egal ob Frau Merkel oder Herr Hollande beiden Politikern war bekannt \"das in der Ukraine Herr Banderas verherrlicht wird und das bis heute. Wieso wurde und wird nichts gegen diese Verherrlichung von Nationsozialistischen Gedankengut gemacht\". Es war eine politische Farce als im kanadischen Parlament 'ein fruheres ukrainisches Mitglied der Waffen SS ausgezeichnet wurde' von den ehemaligen Verb\u00fcndeten der UdSSR im Kampf gegen die Nazis. Da kann man bald denken \"Solange es kein Deutscher sagt sondern ein Ausl\u00e4nder wie zB wenn's ein Ukrainer ooo es sagt ist es ja nicht so schlimm oder b\u00f6se\" und passt ja zu unseren Zielen gegen Russland. \"Genau diese Denkweise gab es schon einmal\" mit verheerenden Folgen f\u00fcr Europa. Auch dort wurde vom b\u00f6sen Russen gesprochen und man muss aufr\u00fcsten und kriegstauglich werden uuu. Alles das was man jetzt in anderen Worten wieder h\u00f6rt. Am Ende gab es Millionen Tote und Opfer und unendliche Zerst\u00f6rung in Europa.",

Russia corrected the deficiencies that the west thought it would exploit, and they built a war machine that was well and truly advanced from the machine it had used in Georgia. Lessons learned - and now, it is the WEST that is learning the hard lessons. Their squeals and their hypocrisy are heard around the world.",

BUT IT MAY BE THAT HISTORY ONLY REMEMBERS HIS HESITATIONS AND LACK OF AMBITION. RUSSIA NOW HAS A HISTORIC CHANCE TO DEFINITELY ESTABLISH ITS INFLUENCE IN EURASIA AND TO ENSURE ITS SECURITY FOR CENTURIES TO COME AGAINST THE WARRIOR INSTINCTS OF THE ANGLOSAXONS. IF PUTIN REFUSES TO INVADE UKRAINE AND DEMAND ITS COMPLETE SURRENDER IN ORDER TO REDESIGN THIS REGION AND ENSURE THE SECURITY AND FUTURE OF RUSSIA, HISTORY WILL NOT FORGIVE HIM THIS MISTAKE.\r\nRUSSIAN VICTORY IN UKRAINE MUST BE TOTAL. UKRAINE MUST BE DISMEMBERED. THE EAST OF THE RIVER DNIEPR AND THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY SHOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. AS FOR THE NORTH-WEST PART, IT MUST BE DEMILITARIZED AND BECOME A NEUTRAL STATE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF RUSSIA. THE REMAINING UKRAINE SHOULD NEVER BE PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION OR NATO. RUSSIA MUST NOT ALLOW ANGLO-AMERICAN CAPITALISM TO RECAPITALIZE ITSELF FROM UKRAINE'S WEALTH. THE ANGLO-AMERICAN PLUNDERING OF OTHER NATIONS THAT HAS BEEN THE BASIS OF THEIR CAPITALIST SYSTEM FOR 500 YEARS MUST END NOW.\r\nTHIS DEFEAT OF NATO AND THE USA WILL ENSURE THE FUTURE OF PEACE BY CLEARLY DEMONSTRATING THAT DIRECT AMERICAN AGGRESSION AS IN AFGHANISTAN OR BY PROXI AS IN UKRAINE CAN ONLY LEAD TO DEFEAT.   \r\nAFTER RUSSIA'S TOTAL VICTORY OVER NATO AND UKRAINE, RUSSIA WILL HAVE TO HOMOGENEIZE THE POPULATIONS, WHICH WILL IMPLY THE DISPLACEMENT OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. THE EAST AND SOUTH HALF WILL BE ALLOCATED TO RUSSIAN SPEAKER AND THOSE WHO WANT TO LIVE WITH RUSSIANS. THE ANTI-RUSSIAN UKRAINIANS WILL HAVE TO BE DEPORTED TO THE NORTH-WEST PART WHICH WILL BE EQUAL TO APPROXIMATELY ONE-FIFTH OF CURRENT TERRITORY WHICH WILL REMAIN UNDER RUSSIAN INFLUENCE. AS FOR UKRAINIANS WHO HAVE FLED THE COUNTRY, THEY MUST BE PREVENTED FROM RETURNING.",

Obviously the ukes wanted better terms than they will now have to settle for, and three years ago they were offered far better terms but they turned them down.

For example: CIA + MI6 + Norway + Germany + Ukraine together blew up Nord Stream pipeline; drone attack on Kremlin; another drone attacks on civilian targets in Moscow without any military targets near; terrorist attack with explosive hidden in e-scooter against a general and his bodyguard in civilian area Moscow; another hidden explosive in civilian area in Moscow. And this is just like a scratch on the surface. The Ukrainians are deliberately targeting civilians in civilian areas deep in Russia with the only goal to make the people angry hoping to provoke them to turn against Putin. But what this complete \u00a1d\u00a1o\u0442s just can't understand is that they are only uniting them, bringing them all together, more and more, making Russian people stronger, resilient, motivated and willing to fight. Du\u043c\u0432 NATO MTHRFCKRS! And they can't even realize that the same \"bad\" man, that they want to get rid of, is exactly the one who is keeping them all safe and sound, saving their pathetic miserable lives with his strong personality and his influence and control over the some of the hardliners and other influential and powerful generals keeping them satisfied and in check not to even think about overthrowing him, mobilizing the whole mighty Russian army and running over every single barking little puppy standing on their pathway to Berlin once again. Or just dealing with all the annoying bugs with RS-28 repellent. 1 for Germany, 1 for France, 1 for Scandinavia, and 1/3 for England. Everything will already be over even before it starts. From the thought in his head, to the words coming from his mouth forming an order, to the learned through countless drills mechanical action of the soldier, who reaches out with his hand and presses the red\ud83d\udea8button, which says, \"ride\u26a1it\", then from the launch of the missile to the bright ball of light erasing London, and to the total annihilation of England - 4min. 44sec. All you Western bureaucrats, political activists, government officials, political representatives, presidents, prime-ministers, \"Kings\" and \"Queen\", it's about time to finally wake the \u0444u\u00a9\u043a up and understand the simple situation and truth. Now, please concentrate and listen very carefully... President of Russia Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin is the only kind of Russian leader-guarantor that such a development will not happen. Unless collective you try to bend him over just like you tried recently and we all know the results of this genius plan of yours. Collective Gang-Bang of one Russian, but this particular Russian wasn't just anyone, but a personal friend, a landlord and a trainee of Steven Seagal. Sorry, you should have known better. 'Cause he flies like a bear with wings, and stings like a horny bear with wings, on 11 bottles of Vodka. So, don't mess with him! Stay away! It is what it is, because he is who he is! Not a joke! And you're lying dog-faced pony soldier! Okey?! C'mon, man! Don't jump, jump, jump, jump, everybody jump, jump around, jump around. Everybody... jump around, jump around, jump up, jump up and get down! \u270c\ufe0fbruh\u2757",

        "text": "Alik Bakhshi\r\n\r\nA slowpoke from the White House\r\n\r\nDonald Trump, literally in the first days of his presidency, promised to stop the bloodshed in Ukraine and save thousands of people from death. As a thrifty owner and businessman, for whom America is above all else, Trump was concerned about America's spending on military aid to Ukraine. He did not care at all under what conditions the war would stop and a peace treaty would be signed between the aggressor and the victim. I believe Trump planned to benefit from the peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine. Having already had experience communicating with Putin, and apparently knowing him as a smart and calculating politician, Trump decided to put pressure on Zelensky first and invited him to the White House in the hope that under the threat of ending military aid, he would be able to persuade the young green politician to make concessions. However, Trump was very wrong, Zelensky surprisingly turned out to be a tough nut to crack, who made it clear to the American businessman that he was not going to trade Ukrainian territory.\r\n\r\nHowever, Zelensky's unsuccessful visit also had a positive side for Ukraine, because against the backdrop of Trump's threat to interrupt arms supplies to Ukraine, EU countries realized the need to ensure Ukraine's victory in its war with fascist Russia on their own. And after three months, Trump also realized the futility of simply persuading to end the bloodshed. Moreover, in order not to look like a lost sheep, Trump abandoned his threat to suspend arms supplies to Ukraine. At the same time, on May 12, European leaders and Trump issued an ultimatum demanding a ceasefire along the entire front line for 30 days and to begin peace talks without delay, otherwise tougher sanctions would be imposed on Russia. Trump promised to transfer weapons to Ukraine in quantities sufficient to defeat the Russian army if Putin refused direct negotiations.\r\n\r\nIt seems that this time Putin, who had been counting on a split between America and the EU, was seriously scared for the first time, so much so that without waiting for the next day, he urgently gathered his servants at 2 a.m. and announced his intention to start direct negotiations with Ukraine on May 15 in Istanbul. However, Putin did not say a word about a 30-day truce. Zelensky, in turn, immediately announced his readiness for a personal meeting with Putin. Here Putin, without expecting it, fell into a trap that he himself had set. It must be said that Putin avoided any debates and, unlike other presidential contenders, never took part in them during the election campaign. It is not difficult to foresee that during a face-to-face meeting, the former comedian showman will devour him alive, especially in the presence of Erdogan and Trump himself, who could not miss an opportunity to get some extra PR, who made him want to fly to such a significant event. Such a prospect was clearly not in the calculation of the Kremlin dictator. Well, what can he tell the whole world - I want war? After all, only war, and preferably a victorious one, reliably ensures his stay on the royal throne. Peace in the current circumstances is like death for Putin. The Russian people, impoverished by the war, with their imperial worldview, will not forgive the Fuhrer for his unfulfilled dreams of reviving the empire and the many thousands of soldiers who died in vain. Naturally, Putin at the last moment refused to meet with Zelensky and belatedly sent negotiators to Istanbul who do not have any authority, with the sole purpose of dragging out these negotiations for as long as possible.\r\n\r\nHow this childishly naive trick of Putin will be perceived depends entirely on Trump, who, I hope, will finally understand his mistake in thinking that the war can be stopped through negotiations without defeating the aggressor. Trump could have really saved thousands of lives if, upon entering the White House, he had not repeated Biden's mistake of supplying weapons in small doses, but had immediately ordered the transfer of weapons to Ukraine in the quantities necessary for victory. Only a convincing victory for Ukraine can thwart Putin's revanchist plans to restore the Russian Empire within the borders of the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\n05/16/2025",

Naturally Russia had no intention of going along with this, what is interesting is that its the exact same negotiating team who Putin sent in March 2022.

Most likely, only the driver survived. 9:23 This tank, for the record, survived at least 4 drones in the total number that remained behind the scenes. And yes, these are 2 or 3 videos where you can see how the tank crew runs out of NATO equipment. So we can only guess how many people survived in Abrams, Leopards, and Challengers, because Ukraine does not want to say how many crews were lost.",

Firstly, the T-90M costs 3 times less than the Leopard 2A7, 3 times less than the Abrams M1A2 and 4 times less than the Challenger 2. Secondly, the T-90 has a better roof reservation, which occupies almost the entire upper part of the tank, which helps a lot in the fight against drones. That's what we've seen in practice. There is a video where the T-90M withstands 7 or 11 hits from airborne drones and still remains alive.",

In russian tanks due to the usage of autoloader, the ammunition is stored in a carousel around the turret so it all explodes launching the turret up in the air. Let's clarify that russian tanks were designed with a different tactics in mind where during cold war they assumed that they need a swarm of cheap small tanks that would push forward in waves regardless of the loses. If crew and vehicles are disposable, that would be a valid tactic at that time. But not when you use them as infantry support in small numbers. Those are zergs, not protons.",

You can't legally use numbers that could differ under some circumstances, if we say 100 percent accuracy up to X Km under perfect conditions, it won't be accepted. You have to either state number's for the different condition's or state the number that would work under every condition. \n\nMajor differnces between Western Tank's and other's. Aside from being build with the crew in mind, you have way higher reserve speed, you don't need to turn and expose weaker parts of  the Armor.

Leopards and Abrams tanks can have a separated ammo compartment so that if it goes up in flames the chances of the crew being affected is minimal. But because the Russian tanks use a carousel type autoloader it is impossible to separate the crew entirely from the ammo (at least in most cases) because it's usually right behind or under the turret basket. Which is why they are famous turret launchers.",

Fire suppression systems have a chance putting out this fire.  The next is 'gunpowder', or more correctly, a propellent fire.  This is signaled by the 'blowtorch flames' shooting out the tank.  Russian tanks have this inside the crew compartment, not isolated like the Abrams, etc.  Once this conflagration starts, it feeds on the next piece of ammunition.  The crew has mere moments to get out.  Fire suppression is not helpful.  The worst event is the detonation of the ammunition's projectiles.  The High Explosive in both HE and HEAT shells evidently can 'cook off' from both a propellent fire, or being actually struck by a penetration, or sympathetically from a drones explosion.  This leads to a triple event of fuel, propellant, and high explosives all getting consumed and the vehicle being ripped apart, and turrets, etc. flying about.  In WWII, the Soviets used very sensitive explosives in their shells.  I would bet they still do.  I don't see how any Russian can serve in an armored vehicle at this point.",

Had we delivered what we REALLY could deliver without any repercussions, the war would have been over about a year ago I would guess. Maybe even earlier... \nThats a lot of brave defenders of freedom that had to die for no real reason... (well their reason is the same and honorable, keeping UA free, but they would never had to fight at all at this point in time).\nIts a effing disgrace how we let UA down! Im german and Im pained by the reports that our equipment is superior, BUT it is being used waaaaaay to little, due to maintenance/resupply issues! And then there is the fact that germany doesnt need one single effing tank, as long as our Ukrainian siblings keep \"holding the fort\"! Like give them every effing last piece of equipment we effing have!

This is the new generation of IFVs, the Bradley and Abrams as well as the Leo2 are more than 40 years old.

Thales is finalizing an active protection system named PROMETEUS to intercept incoming ATGMs, shells or drones before they hit.\nI don't get why some are not being at last tested in Ukraine, even if they're in teething phase, these are really impressive.",

He will attack Ukraine during his so called ceasefire, which he only wants to have his party in safety, but still commit his atrocities against children,old people and civilians, can\u2019t hit military targets. He only wants this 3 days to party that\u2019s all. Nothing to do with talks of peace, just so he can have his parade. He must think Ukraine is stupid and expect them to stop drones for him, I hope they really messed it up. Those countries that attended are just as bad as him. Those wanting in to EU, well EU needs to closely at them. Do they really need garbage like this in the EU, or those in the EU that support Putin, should these countries really be part of the EU. They seem untrustworthy and maybe more of a risk than benefiting the EU.",

Je m'explique. Poutine peut avoir deux r\u00e9actions face aux menaces de l'Ukraine. \n\n1 : Il met en place une d\u00e9fense tr\u00e8s importante sur Moscou et se concentre essentiellement sur le d\u00e9fil\u00e9. Mais se faisant \u00e7a laissera le champ Libre \u00e0 l'Ukraine pour attaquer durement beaucoup d'autre point strat\u00e9gique.\n2. Poutine ne prend pas au s\u00e9rieux les menaces de l'Ukraine et continue son d\u00e9fil\u00e9 avec une d\u00e9fense standard importante mais pas exceptionnelle. Ce qui laissera le champ libre aux ukrainiens d'attaquer durement Moscou pendant le d\u00e9fil\u00e9.\n\nDans les deux cas Poutine est dans une position inconfortable parce que quoiqu'il fasse il subira une attaque puissante.

If I had production/fund limits this is what i'd do for example, launch 99 unarmed drones + 1 armed drone. let russia exhaust 100 missiles for a tiny cost, and maybe even get a strike on the target but keep russia guessing as theres a warhead in there somewhere so they cant ignore them.\n\nIf after a few launches they stop intercepting them then launch 100 armed drones on the chance they also get ignored.\n\nIts not exactly a new tactic but not sure why its not being used more heavily in this conflict were the cost of arms is a big factor.",

By 1996, Ukraine had returned all of its nuclear warheads to Russia in exchange for economic aid and security assurances, and in December 1994, Ukraine became a non-nuclear weapon state-party to the 1968 nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). The last strategic nuclear delivery vehicle in Ukraine was eliminated in 2001 under the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). It took years of political maneuvering and diplomatic work, starting with the Lisbon Protocol in 1992, to remove the weapons and nuclear infrastructure from Ukraine.",

        "text": "The bias of this vlog is typical but did no favors to the Zelenskyy regime -- rather the opposite, especially as the non-president was so smug and sneering in his presentation. It can be viewed in full on many sites.\nThe Russian idea of a 3 day cease fire for the 80th anniversary of VE Day during a claimed 30 day sort of cease fire declared by Kiev, which even EU elite figures had no belief in, could be seen as equally unrealistic.\nGiven Kiev's thirst for headlines, the Kremlin cast several lures at once. The parade and days leading up to it, the cancellation/postponement of the Black Sea celebration and not using jamming of US and ESA satellites at the weapons factories at surface level. I was reminded of British tactics in late 1944 when dummy planes and armored vehicles were moved about a bit so Nazi recon photographs showed apparent assets in various stages of preparation/maintenance.\nTo be eve more convincing if Goering's remnants made attacks, the RAF used old oil and tyres to burn to confuse attackers and, above all, obscure large areas. Attacking aircraft were brought down or not to leave enough to reach home and confuse commanders more thoroughly. This less to carelessness in signaling and decryption became easier and regular RAF night bombing of Germany continued but USAAF and RCAF B-24s with Mustangs and Hurricanes making day attacks on retreating German forces, led by RAF Mosquito dawn marker aircraft in large quantities, some using new transponder marking instead of fire across large fronts.\nIn these days of drone use [given by the USA etc for defense] it was easy for Russia to predict where drones and long range rockets would be aimed at. \nThe phrase \"appropriate response\" is not the same as equal response because Russia will not simply launch drones but use a mix of weapons for surgical strikes and where Kiev stores and even makes some drones as well as the armor repair hubs from the north, east, south and parallel to the Polish border import points.\nPossibly, Russia will shorten the skirmishing time on the Pokrovsk front with quite cheap thermobaric bombing from OTH helicopters and Su-25s then the waiting armored columns will make for Dnipro city for talks but it is unlikely that its oblast will be added to the 'fraternal 4' for new capital reasons. Dnipro city is a good site for an administrative capital of Ukraine Mk 2.",

The German army, mainly pensioners and children because this late in the war, most of the men were already dead, was on ruzzian soil and about to take Moscow. Ruzzia with the homefield advantage was losing to a much smaller and much, MUCH lesser equipped german army. So Stalin went begging to the west for aid. The USA supplied ruzzia with hundreds of billions of dollars (in 2025 dollars) in fuel, weapons, machinery and even food...yes, ruzzia couldn't even provide their people with food that's how incompetent they were/are. But even *WITH* this help, the ruzzians were STILL losing to the german army. So Stalin once again came out begging. This time the allieds decided to spread out the german army's attention by opening up a second front...on the west coast of France in a small town called Normandy....Perhaps you've heard of it? It was called D-Day! Yes. With tremendous effort and with the intention of saving ruzzia's ass, the allieds went all in, and it worked! The now even more weakened german army in moscow was now easier to defeat for even the ruzzians to complete the mission and they were able to save Moscow...Stalin later wrote in his memoirs, that \"if it hadn't been for the United States and it's machines of war, ruzzia would have surely falled to the german army\"...yes, that's how close it was. So ruzzia *DIDN'T* defeat the nazis...at least not on their own...the only reason they're not speaking German now is because of the combined efforts of the USA, Britain, Canada and France!",

The Russian Federation does not function in a way that here now you want it, it only functions and broadcasts on \"FANTASTIC\" television from Moscow, but this is a world of visions and delusions. Russian production of military equipment is not impressively large \"AS FOR THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CURRENT WAR, WHAT WE HAVE HERE AND NOW\". The Russian Federation does not function indefinitely. And that something is shown on propaganda television from Moscow, it is only shown, they are happy because they gave them hope, the reality is worse. The television theory and reality, it is really something completely different!!!!!!! The G7 countries provide greater possibilities for now. The BRICS countries are not able to produce the appropriate amount of military equipment for a specific time, on top of that they are technologically backward. Therefore, in any number of years the Russian Federation will definitely not win this war. There will be more and more war mercenaries. You Russians are dying unnecessarily. But this is already a certain, wrong ideological idea. Here, certain hunter schemes should come out in order to save a larger number of people. But this will not work in old or new Russia, so they die unnecessarily, gaining nothing for themselves, except only losses. As for the acquisition of a small area of \u200b\u200bUkrainian land in 3 years, where the number of dead Russian soldiers is slowly approaching 740,000. Your comrade Joseph Stalin made a record, he caused the deaths of 24,000,000 Russians in various circumstances. The Ukrainian land acquired for the Russian Federation will be almost imperceptible in comparison to the vastness of the largest country in the world, so one should think before the war (???). Except that this is Russia, so as always Russians must die in any large number with or without sense (???). Warmest regards! Herman Knippenberg.",

The second clue would be another elementary school named Smythe whose color was painted light green at the end of Madrid street. I like to point out that I used that word as a replacement for smite, when buddy and 86 went to meet the monster buddy uttered \" look for the weakest side and smythe at the most opportune time\".

Because when Medina showed up at 86's doorstep and  offered a cup of tea was December the 14 when the Virgin of Guadalupe is celebrated...Best wishes to my friends.",

Having a leader of such low caliber governing a nation is a disaster for humanity.\nOf course , witnessing the failure of the EU is disheartening, and it is widely acknowledged that the primary reason lies in the short-sightedness of individual EU countries, each prioritizing their own benefits without considering others. Every outcome has its underlying reasons. Had the EU taken decisive action at the onset of the war, Russia might have already been defeated. Fear of war is an unwise stance when confronted with a dictator, as numerous historical accounts have demonstrated this lesson.",

Satan and his fallen Angels fought God\u2019s angels to overthrow God but were defeated and were thus thrown out of heaven to the earth (Isaiah14:12-14 AND Revelation 12:7-10). Satan and his fallen Angels will be thrown into hell to be tormented 24/7 forever and ever (Revelation 20:10 AND Jude 1:7). Satan and his fallen Angels want you to join them and suffer in hell even though you were not part of the coup makers (Revelation 20:10-15). Satan, and for that matter his fallen Angels stand condemned by God and hence do not have any chance of repentance(John 16:11). Fortunately, you and I have up to minutes before our death to repent just like the criminal on the right side of Jesus Christ on the cross (Luke 23:39-43) WHY NOT REPENT NOW AND GIVE YOUR LIFE TO JESUS? Since you don\u2019t know how and when you will die, my brother or sister, THE TIME TO REPENT IS NOW AND GIVE YOUR LIFE TO JESUS CHRIST!!!",

Trump knew Putin won't go unless Trump was going there personally, power houses know what makes them look weak that's why Trump knew sending US delegation was only going to be met with a russian delegation. The only place a US not a wetern or Ukrainan delegation would have a small change of meeting Putin himself would be in Moscow and not any other country. Trump knows that, Xi knows that and Putin knows that (the power houses towards each other know they don't play weak but either of these 3: strategic, strong or mutual cards). With China, it's easier to have its delegations meet Putin in another country if it just so happens that Putin is around while on another business trip (NOTE: not traveling there extra to meet Chinese delegation). They both have had a good and respectful relationship for long and would be meeting on common grounds and not conflict, for US it's a bit difficult coz we know US has for long been using condescending tone and using force against Russia coz they thought Russia has to bow down to them, which doesn't put them in the same friendly position as China's delegations and except for the few chosen US persons, Putin would only deal face to face with a US presidents and not anyone lower. That is why Trump won't respond much to the expectation of those who don't understand that and thought Putin would bow down to Zelensky or western leaders ultimatum. It would be a big win for Zelensky to make Putin bow to his or any other western leaders' pressure and do what they wish. Only Xi or Trump going to Istanbul and on respectful terms not pressure or ultimatums would make Putin make the effort. We know Xi and Putin handle each other with mutual respect all the time since we know them as leaders of their countries. Trump apparently knows very well he has to stay away from condescending tone if he wants to have any conversation with Putin. Biden used harsh tones and it got him nowhere, western Europe still use tough tone and beat chest even though they've achieved nothing with it for years now other than make their countries' economy harder to bear. Tough tone won't get them anywhere but they still can't see that and move around like lost flock following the comedian, they'll learn that sooner or later. Then they will start talking about giving Russia what it first demanded because by the time they realize they'll get nowhere with chest beating, they'll have lost more but they'll have to settle with what would have been left or lose even more\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.

The fact is the Russian completed the construction of the Kerch Bridge from the Russian mainland to Crimea in 2018 without seeking approval of Ukraine. The Kerch Bridge provides the military logistic key to supply Russian troops in Crimea and those operating in south east Ukraine. The west has had the military capability  to destroy the use of the Kerch Bridge since its completion yet has refused to provide Ukraine with these means to do so even today. The west programme of military aid to Ukraine has been a deliberate and carefully measured response by holding back key weapons systems from HIMARS, tanks, military aircraft, long range missiles in full knowledge that the longer the war proceeded the most likely outcome would be the collapse of the small Russian economy. This fact was always a understood from its beginning in 2014 and on into 2022 with previous known understanding of western intelligence agencies of the Russia invasion of Ukraine in 2022.  Yet at no time has the West supplied cruise missiles capable disrupting Russian supply logistics over the Kerch Bridge. \n\n\nThe logistic length of supply of military resources over the Kerch Bridge is 18 kilometres from the Russian main land to Crimea,  without the Kerch it would become over 800 kilometres and untenable. The question is why has it not been rendered inoperable?  The only logical answer is the actual history of the war supply chain by the West including its refusal to supply the military means to destroy the use of the bridge and thus ending the war at least in Crimea and the South Eastern parts of Ukraine.  The only reasonable conclusion is to deliberately ensure the war continues to the extent of Russian economic collapse in league with the  political intrigue disposed by of the West. Of course it meant Ukraine pays the price for defeat of Russia that has been a source of massive expense to the west for over 100 years. So the fact is Putin was known not show to himself in Turkey given the universal warrant for his arrest and the understood fact that  Putin cannot sue for peace having butchered almost one million Russian soldiers. So it is thee plan proceeding has planed for.",

Not much different to the meeting just after the war started in 2022.\n\"As part of a failed 2022 deal, Ukraine had agreed to no NATO membership and  permanent neutrality in return for security guarantees from the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council: Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, and other nations including Belarus, Canada, Germany, Israel,\nPoland and Turkey.\nPeace deal broke down due to no discussion on returning Crimea to Ukraine. It would, however, seek EU membership. Among other points of disagreement in the 2022 negotiations was Russia's demand for deep cuts to the size of Ukraine's armed forces and the number of its tanks, missiles, warplanes and other weapons.\nThe U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War wrote in an analysis that the terms of the Istanbul protocol draft would have left Ukraine helpless to defend itself against any future threat from Russia.\"\nNothing has changed from Putin's demands in 2025, except he wants to keep more territory and for NO countries to provide security guarantees to Ukraine. \nPeace deal is meaningless except for Russia.",

The restrictions on Ukraine over the past 3 years while everyone just wanted to wait and see, hoping not to upset Putin, not to escalate, pretending that this would all go away, DID NOT WORK.  WAS NEVER THE ANSWER.\n\nHere is what will happen now.\n\nUkraine has been weakened, they have lost their citizens, their soldiers, their losses have been large, their population can no longer support.\n\nThe west has allowed North Korea to fight with Russia yet have provided restricted support not wanting to escalate, WHAT A JOKE.\n\nThe west have relieved their Military Stockpiles of all of their garbage, the US has restricted what could be allowed to Ukraine and how it could be used, the West has exhausted Ukraine, Russia has not stopped, have not gone away. \n\nThe West, because they have handled this so poorly, will now have to align themselves to prepare for war against Russia, possibly with Ukraine on the side of Russia when the ceasefire comes to effect and then, Putin takes Kiev and all of Ukraine.  Ukraine will become part of Russia, the West, your sons, your daughters, your mothers and fathers, will be fighting against Ukraine.  Ukraine will develop their new weapons to use against the West, that will be Devastating.  The West will also lose to Russia.  Russia will become the largest military in the world, Because the West does not want to risk escalation.    In 20 years, the History Books will look much different now than they would have had the west stood up to Russia 3 years ago.    The end is near, there is not much time to enjoy and savor what we once had.",

As in normal diplomacy he is sending a team to work through discussions leading to a stoppage of combat eventually. Once all details are figured out, foreign ministers will meet and perhaps a ceasefire arranged and only after that, if peace is agreed, will heads of state meet. This is the correct process.\n\nIt was Zelensky who declared that he would go to Istanbul, but that he would not engage with the Russian delegation, but only with Putin - who was never going to attend anyway. Zelensky, who has no desire for peace unless he wins in negotiations what he is losing on the battlefield, knows that Putin will not turn up, will declare Putin does not want peace and will score a mere media victory (only in the West) while he continues to lose men and territory on the battlefield. It seems this war will only end on the battlefield.",

In April 2022 Ukraine and Russia agreed to peace and initialed the agreement which wouldve prevented bloodshed and Ukraine wouldve kept everything except Crimea. The next day Boris Johnson flew to Kiev and made sure that the agreement was broken!\nNow, if there is an agreement, Ukraine will be forced to give 20-25% of its territory! \n\nUkraine NEVER had a chance to win this war! Only complete idiots thought otherwise. They were used to destabilize Russia and pushed into inevitable destruction. May Ukrainian mothers forgive those naive/stupid people who pushed Ukrainian young men to their deaths just so that the military industrial complex shareholders can make some extra money!\n#disgustingwarmongers",

When Russia wanted peace negotiations EU Zalenzki and Boris Johnson especially stopped Russia signing the peace agreement although putin since 2022 pushed for peace negotiations. Now EU have run out of funds and Russia has systematically gained most of Ukrainian Land and the Ukrainians are being killed in large numbers Putin has won the war praise be to our Lord jesus Christ.  If US wants to start supplying more weapons there is no difference between Biden and Trump thats what the Biden administration did and sanctioned Russia and destroyed the Nord Stream and then supplied the US LNG to Europe. Now US wants  Ukrainian  minerals the war had nothing to do with Putin or Russia US all along with Lindsey Graham wanted to exploit the minerals fro Ukrain they never cared for Zalenzki or his nation that is why the US appointed a puppet Zalenzki and overthrow the democratically elected president of Ukraine.  Putin is blessed and protected by Jesus Christ himself this leader of Russia overcame all forms of harassment on his nation by the power of God, the sanctions and the sabotage on the Nor Stream but God is with him. US will never cheat God.",

Only way for this war to be over is for Putin to die or lose the war completely! Zelensky knows this, all the world leaders know this. Only one who lives in his little bubble is Trump! Idiot as always! I think since Trump is not willing to help Ukraine financially in order to continue fighting against Russia, is better for the US to stay out of any future negotiations! Trump's shitty deals to Zelensky won't help end the war! Ukraine will have to keep relying to its world allies for any kind of help until Putin dies and the war ends! Either way Ukraine needs to win in this terrible war!",

Trump would fight like hell against Putin to stop Putin from taking over Alaska, just as now Ukrainians are  now fighting  against Russia for illegally occupying Ukrainian territories, as  it is,  Ukraine is now fighting for its independence,  its sovereignty & right to existential survival!\nJust because Ukraine's lands are invaded by Russia & not American lands invaded by  Russia,  Trump simply doesn't care two hoots  about Ukraine as Ukraine is not America's land, otherwise Trump would fight  Putin's Russia if Russia wants to tyrannically take back Alaska which was formerly Russian land!",

The entire world, and certainly all the war mongers of the EU, have no place in these talks they do not have the interests of Ukraine at heart and seek to grandstand and use Ukraine as their model for war mongering purposes.  Has Ukraine not had enough of Britain's interference.. this war would not have started but for Britain's interference in seeing the 2022 peace accord was not honoured. Putin has said \"it is important that we work together and settle this as neighbours and as brothers..to ensure we have a long lasting peace\"... and this must be so. A better leader than Zelensky would have been wiser for Ukraine... and the question is asked, who has the power in Ukraine to sign off any agreement reached? Perhaps this person has to be leading the negotiations. Zelensky forced on Ukraine the crazy law of it being illegal for Ukrainians to dialogue and negotiate with Russia... so how are those currently at the negotiating table have the legal right to be there?",

Russia did! Nato or no nato. Nobody wanted to start a war with Russia. The world has been on the defence with russia since    their revolution. \nRussia has been eye balling ukraine since the 80s. America confinced Ukraine to give up their nukes with a promise to defend Ukraine AGAINST      Russian aggression! We failed on our promise and failed Russia. We have a coward as president and abandoned  out promise! We are disgraced! Ukrainians owe Russia nothing but vengeance!",

Expecting that Russia will \u201cgrow tired\u201d and retreat is a profoundly unhistorical forecast.

That said, do you really believe Russia would accept any other terms from Ukraine and NATO other than it's own terms that they laid out in 2022 before Boris Johnson intervened and stopped Ukraine from negotiating? The reality is there's really no end to this war until Russia takes Odessa and landlocks western Ukraine and NATO because it will want total control of the black sea and every ship or sub tgat passes through there because that's their border and therefore a big security concern right now and in the future especially if a more hostile president replaces trump like Biden after Trump leaves office. We would never allow anyone near our waters that border our mainland so what makes people think that Russia wouldn't do the same?",

    "description": "In a significant development, Russian President Vladimir Putin has offered Ukraine the opportunity to restart peace talks without preconditions, proposing Turkey as the meeting venue. In response, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed a desire for a ceasefire and welcomed Putin to Turkey for dialogues. Both leaders have not met face-to-face since 2019, raising questions about the feasibility of these peace talks.\u00a0\r\n\r\n#russia #ukraine #wion \r\n\r\nAbout Channel: \r\n\r\nWION The World is One News examines global issues with in-depth analysis.

    "description": "Local officials say nine people have been killed in a Russian drone attack on a civilian bus in north-eastern Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThe Sumy regional military administration said four other people were injured in the town of Bilopillia on Saturday morning as the bus travelled to the regional capital Sumy, close to Russia's border. \r\n\r\nThe reported attack comes just hours after Russia and Ukraine held their first direct peace talks since 2022 - no breakthrough was achieved, although a swap of prisoners of war was agreed. \r\n\r\nUkraine's national police described the bus attack as a \"cynical war crime\". Russia has not commented directly but said it had hit a \"military staging area\" in Sumy.\r\n\r\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\r\n\r\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \r\n\r\n#Ukraine #BBCNews",

We are ALL sinners - (Rom. 6:23) For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Sin separates us from the Holy God\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. There is a punishment for our sin -(Rom. 6:23a) For the wages of sin is death;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Death - eternal death - HELL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. God loves us, He does not want us to go to Hell, He provided a way for our escape from Hell - (Rom. 5:8) But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Because of God's love for us, He sent his only son Jesus Christ to die in our place on the cross. Jesus Christ took all the weight of our sins so we can be saved through grace, NOT our works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* The blood that Jesus shed on the cross can wash away our sins and make us clean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Through Jesus Christ, we can now have eternal life in HEAVEN - (Rom. 6:23b) but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Gift - free, but you can only have it if you receive it. If you reject it then the punishment of Hell is waiting for you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. How can I receive eternal life? - (Rom. 10:9) That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* You have to admit you are a sinner and you cannot save yourself from Hell nor go to Heaven through your own efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0You have to believe in your heart that Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins, was buried and rose again after 3 days and that He and only He can save you from hell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Roman 10:13) For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Whosoever means anyone including me and you!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to do it? Pray this prayer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear God, I admit I am a sinner and cannot save myself from hell. I believe that Jesus Christ died for my sins, was buried and rose again. I believe that only\u00a0 Jesus Christ can save me from Hell and He is the only way to Heaven.\u00a0 I accept Jesus Christ in my heart as my Lord and Savior. Thank You for eternal life. Amen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,",

        "text": "The American Empire started this war and the Russian Federation will inevitably finish it. This 11 year conflict began when the CIA orchestrated a violent political coup which overthrew the democratically elected leader Victor Yanukovych and installed a US friendly illegitimate ultra nationalist regime with ties to far right paramilitaries such as the Azov Battalion and Svoboda in 2014. This coup split the country into a brutal civil war between the new US friendly government of Kiev and Donbas oblasts of Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea friendly to Moscow that didn't recognise the new regime, resulting in over 15,000 civilian casualties and 50,000 fleeing into Russia. President Poroshenko never honoured the Minsk peace accords that was brokered between Moscow and the EU and even former German chancellor Angela Merkel admitted in an interview that Minsk was just a stalling tactic to flood Ukraine full of NATO weaponry for their assault on the donbas but for something much more dangerous. To the Russians, they could never allow Ukraine to become a NATO member, but remain neutral. They would never allow the Crimean peninsula to be used by the US navy. This was always a red line for the Russians who always demanded Ukrainian neutrality for their national security concerns going back to the times of Baker and Gorbachev who agreed that NATO should never expand any further east of Germany regardlessof their security treaty with Ukraine. Obviously these treaties were broken due to aggressive NATO expansion  after the cold war. Even Putin in the early 2000s asked for NATO membership. After all NATO was created to counter the Soviet Union and the cold war ended, but Putin was refused because of the old NATO docturine, \" keep the US up, Germans down and the Russians out. \" If Russia was a member then what was the point of NATO continuing without a constant enemy and obviously the profits of the US military industrial complex aka the US economy. When the Kiev regime never honoured the Minsk accords and donbas autonomy, Donetsk and Luhansk became independent states and called for direct Russian military assistance. Zelensky campaigned on peace, but when he gained power he quickly realised that he had zero control over the Ukrainian military and the ultra nationalist paramilitaries fighting in the east. In fact these Azov forces publicly humiliated Zelensky and even Ukrainian commanders admitted in the Kiev Independent that they \" take their orders from Washington.\" And even the paramilitaries were on the payroll of the CIA as revealed by the LA times. Zelensky tried to negotiate peace but even his diplomats were suspicious assassinated some believing by the SBU. And when he tried to negotiate a ceasefire in April 2022, the UK prime minister Boris Johnson personally flew to Kiev and scuttled the peace talks  negotiations mediated by Turkey and Israel, promising Zelensky what he couldn't deliver. Full NATO membership. Zelensky soon realised that he was just a puppet of the American Empire, a poster boy for NATO to turn Ukraine into Afghanistan 2.0 where the Ukrainians will be used a cannon fodder for the Washington neocon project of trying to destabilise Russia and eventually balkanise Russia into weaker demilitarised microstates ripe for western plunder. But mainly for war profits for the US military industrial complex. Wash money out of the NATO tax basis and into the hands of the transnational security elite. To the Russians this was a direct threat to their  national security. And given Putin the excuse to conduct the SMO and annex the regions constitutionally into the Russian Federation. The objectives was clear. Secure the donbas and Crimea and create a buffer zone and then demilitarise Ukraine of NATO. Ukraine now is a failed state. Zelensky is no longer president of Ukraine. His presidential constitutional term has expired back in May 2024 and since then he declared himself the unelected de-facto ruler of Ukraine, installed martial law, arrested the main opposition party leaders and banned 11 political parties. He has arrested journalists, banned several news media organisations and consolidated the rest into his own state media apparatus. He has allowed the ultra nationalists to run amok within the Ukrainian military and allowed his SBU to round up untrained men and throw them on the front lines at the Russian war machine. The most disturbing fact was he allowed the SBU to set up a international kill list website called Mirotvorec which targets dissenters to the war such as politicians, activists, journalists and musicians. And a CBS report collaboration with the WaPo and New York Times revealed how the Ukrainian military top brass were skimming NATO money and weaponry and selling it to the international illegal arms trade markets. \nThis conflict has not only devastated Ukraine, but economically devastated the EU when the German government allowed the US military to directly destroy their own nord stream pipeline infrastructure with Russia in a sabotage operation revealed by pulitzer prize winner journalist Seymour Hersh, for American expensive LNG and refined Russian oil and gas via India. The Americans now have made their new minerals deal and Zelensky will pay tribute. Zelensky under orders of Trump is demanding Zelensky make peace now to secure those mineral rights as the Russian military is gaining ground every day at the expense of the Ukrainian people. At the end of the day Ukraine will split into two parts. One part will be owned by American kleptocrats and the other part will be owned by Russian kleptocrats. I dont know which will be worse. Ukraine is just another victim in a long line of victims of American imperialism and the US are desperate to wrap up this war they started, like in Syria, so they turn their neocon agenda to Iran and China. \n\" to be America's enemy is dangerous, but to be its friend is fatal. \" - American war criminal Henry Kissenger",

The first war was World War II, when the Germans captured this region, she was 16 years old then and she studied at a technical school. She told me that then they were forced to bury the corpses. I did not ask her whose corpses they ordered and who forced them. I was afraid that her health would deteriorate. A couple of years ago, she was offered to move to a boarding school for the disabled in the city of Sumy, she refused and does not want to leave at all. Later, Russia struck a missile at this school for the disabled. Near her house there was an oak tree that was planted when she got married. The oak was about 80 years old, it was huge. A year ago, she made an agreement with someone and they cut it down. She was afraid that it would fall on the house and destroy the roof. It can fall on the house because of artillery. The border with Russia is 15 km away.  This city is regularly shelled. The post office is not working there now and many shops are closed. There are many old people there who have nowhere to go or who refused to evacuate.",

Ukraine has been assassinating not just military officials, but governors, school teachers, and donors.

You will see that as soon as NATO stops sponsoring the war and leaves in disgrace, like from Afghanistan, the people of Ukraine will think about it, hold their presidential elections without US interference, and then peace will come, and the new Ukraine will become something like Belarus for Russia.\nFor reference:\nBy 2025, about 28,937 sanctions were imposed against Russia.\nBy 2025, Ukraine has lost\nmore than 130,000 square kilometers, which is the size of Greece.More than 10 million Ukrainians have become citizens of Russia.And Zelensky gave the United States resources for debts.",

Putin, promised him that when the Ukraine will be controlled by Russia he will get the region which belong to Hungary before I World War. Recently Ukrainian counter intelligence arrested three Hungarian spies in that region! Former Polish ruling party PiS was in a very good cooperation with Orban. In the first week of invasion, Polish Prime Minister offered Ukrainians that Polish soldiers can enter western Ukraina to protect people living there they offer was rejected by Zelensky. Such new borders of Poland and Hungary means that both politics Orban and Kaczynski will rule Poland and Hungary forever. They both betrayed European Union values and NATO Treaty.

However the problem is United States alliance called NATO they've used it to occupy countries because they're the ones that violated the terms not to expand NATO to President Gorbachev in March 8 1991 a written agreement that not one inch would expand East unfortunately they violated by pushing 14 countries into the NATO alliance which means that are all US military bases in those additional countries. Romania being on the border of Ukraine is United States is building the biggest military base and that's a conflict which borders Ukraine and that's a huge problem. The United States needs to leave your period because all this is becoming more and more imperial by lying to NATO countries to join the alliance and then they occupy them. It's reverse engineering of the Soviet Union that's why Russia retaliated because you cannot have this security threat by the United States into europe. So Rush is on the right side of History and they should take more territory of Ukraine because that's all the United States wants to do is they want to take Ukraine for their interest at the same time United States does not have any conflict in America with Canada and Mexico if China or Russia had military alliances in their backyard they were never accepted. So you have to think about you know what is right and what is wrong and Russia is right",

Trump and his son-in-law could make it into a casino resort for the degenerates who own the world. A sort of kinky new Switzerland.\n\nBlackrock thinks it owns most of the land in what the West thinks of as Ukraine. And Trump thinks he owns its rare Earth metals and minerals, but Zelensky also sold that stuff to the UK and probably others.\n\nAnd Zelensky had no right to sell anything. \n\nFolks need to stop joking around here. This map is not a Russian government\nmap, but it is a sensible one, allocating the oblasts essentially by their dominant ethnicities. The Russians will end up having to settle who gets what, because no one else is being honest and because Russians look after Russians. Putin will see to it that Russians (including Transnistria), Moldovans, and Hungarians have fuel, and he will have to landlocked the rump Ukrainian state to keep everyone safe. \n\nTrump can pretend to be a disinterested party, but the US started and has funded the conflict, and Trump missed his chance to dump the dirty project, so it is his war now and he has lost. \n\nThe only reason the US is still squabbling is to protect BlackRock\u2019s interest, which is what Trump did with the Panama Canal.\n\nIf Ukraine unconditionally surrendered right now, it would save many lives. It could probably keep the \u201cPolish\u201d section. Nobody wants those oblasts anyway.",

If there was a possibility of buying Lviv back or, for example, exchanging it for Che\u0142m or Przemy\u015bl, Ukraine knows where to contact us. From the more distant areas of Ukraine, such as Volhynia, we only care about the bones of victims of massacres by Ukrainian nationalists, which we want to bury. We do not want these lands even if they paid us. It would be very convenient for Russia to antagonize Poles and Ukrainians against each other again, but we have already been through this. Despite my sentiment for Lviv, I would never want the Polish army to attack Ukraine. If it could be arranged diplomatically, then great, if not, then it should be respected and that's it.\n\r\nWhy would we dismantle Ukraine with Russia, which would then start to pressure us and vassalize us? This is nonsense, and we know Russia too well to go for it. And I am sure that the Romanians have the same approach. I do not say anything about the Hungarians because they and Slovakia are ridiculous countries. By the way, Slovakia is shouting very loudly for a country built from the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary. Maybe some partition should be done here? Despite personal dislike for Hungary, the fact is that our nations are friendly and a common border in Slovakia would be fine for us. It's funny that Slovakia is going with a country that has claims to their lands (Hungary).\n\nI will also emphasize one thing. Russia offered us these territories after the collapse of communism and there was a sounding out of Poland whether it would go with Russia against Ukraine around 2009. We refused in both cases. I will not be false because yes, it would be nice to have Lviv in Poland, but only if there was such an option and Ukraine did it voluntarily through diplomacy. But if it meant antagonism between us again, then this is a price that is not worth it. Ukraine must be between us and Russia. And if they were to give us Lviv hypothetically, then it would be nice to have compensation, for example in Rostov-on-Don and those areas. And it is worth reminding the Muscovites that if they are so honorable and want to give us back our former territories, then let them let Belarus go free and give us and Lithuanians Kr\u00f3lewiec for division and Smolensk. These were also our territories, so let them be consistent.",

Zelenskyy blew Israel off when he could have received better peace agreement than he can get now as he is losing war of attrition!  That Israel walked away tells US that Zelenskyy is not reasonable!

Recognizing Ukraine\u2019s territory in full was practically an unquestionable foreign policy of any Polish government since the moment Poland become free from the Soviet control. The idea of relinquishing Poland\u2019s claim over the Galicia and Volhynia, that were annexed into the Soviet Ukraine after the WWII, was thought out by the Polish emigres for, among other reasons, a way to settle the question of Poland\u2019s Western borders that similarly moved to the West into the previously German-controlled territory after the war. No less importantly, Polish intellectuals saw a need to have a strong Ukraine as a way to counter a potential threat from Russia. (Look up Juliusz Mieroszewski and Jerzy Giedroyc)\n\nFrom time to time one can read news about Ukraine and Poland arguing with each other about their shared history, I know that history does not like hypotheticals, but I think it is nothing in comparison to what these relations could have been without the Polish-Ukrainian reconciliation that has happened throughout the years. You got to remember that prior to that in the XX century the Polish-Ukrainian conflicts were brutal, there was an enormous amount of mutual animosity.",

Yes, I'm sure such crimes are being committed on both sides, but people should stop making out the Ukrainians are whiter than white.  They're not.

You people just follow the herd, and probably think the war began in 2022 in an \"invasion\". East Ukraine is Russian speaking, and has been under siege by Ukranian forces for years - for the CRIME OF SPEAKING RUSSIAN. What kind of country outlaws a language and punishes citizens who speak it, under threat of imprisonment and execution? Won't even get into Azov batllion and Right Sector. It just blows my mind. We shouldn't be supporting either side, but praying for peace. If you really care about the Ukranian people you would support an end to this warm and let the Russian speaking territories govern themselves, or join Russia if that's what they want. It is clearly the will of Dontesk and Lugansk to be in Russia, so why force them to be Ukranian? Crimea is a no brainer, they are Russian speaking Tatars, yet we have westerners saying \"Free Crimea\".\n\nStop spreading propoganda and deception, there is SO much deception about this conflict and you people are just hypnotized to it, and pick sides while dehumanizing the other. These are human beings. And you have zero memory about OUR role (as Americans)- If the State department and Biden/Obama admins would have just STAYED THE F*CK OUT of this country.. and left the situation alone, 1.5 million people would still be alive. \n\nI will never speak on this again because it's useless. People just eat up whatever corrupt corporate media tells them, with a track record like theirs, after we saw how they handled COVID... It just sickens me. Try having a F**king mind of your own.",

And these were old men, women, and children in the city of Kyiv! Then, against the odds, they stopped Putin's line of tanks that he thought he'd just walk into the city with and take over easily. HA! The joke is on Putin! Every step of the way he has made old school blunders from Soviet era, using ancient tanks and not counting on the Ukrainian people to get smarter and smarter very fast.. the world is impressed with the Ukraine. Europe, the US, everyone is behind you! Here in my household we keep you in our prayers and pray for peace. We know you will eventually win, we just pray that it doesn't take Putin's dumb ass to take too long to realize that he's already lost, and that he will stop sacrificing soldiers to death like the Maya people did 500 years ago. I don't know how the leader of a country could be allowed to do that to his own people. Good luck to you all, and Godspeed.\nFrom the USA.",

And I just closely followed the laws that were passed in Ukraine and Russia. And as surprising as it may sound, the laws were absolutely identical, practically at the same time the presidents signed an amendment to the law on organ transplantation, making their citizens donors by default. Previously, a legally executed permit was required. They legalized the right of the state to restrict the civil rights of citizens, introduce bans on movement around the country and leaving the country, legalized strict censorship and much more. This is not a war, this is a common bloody business of the rulers of Ukraine and Russia. During the entire military action, not a single missile even flew close or fell near the castles of the oligarchs, the government, deputies and other ruling scum. In Ukraine, there is only one oil refinery, which belongs to the Jewish oligarch Kolomoysky.\u00a0 If this plant had been bombed, the Ukrainian army would have had huge problems with fuel, but not a single missile even flew nearby or fell.",

It would basically be a bunch of long metal poles sticking out on the vehicle in all directions To make the drone detonate at a distance to help mitigate the Blast damage. Not sure how practical or effective that would be, but it\u2019s just a thought. I guess it\u2019s a similar concept to the nets or cages. I would call it the porcupine lol. Other ideas similar and concept Would be a bunch of nozzles Placed  around a vehicle that shoot a high pressure stream of water. So basically a bunch of water cannons. Or maybe just the one large water cannon at the top center of the vehicle on a turret system that can be operated by a soldier To deflect incoming drones. Another idea would be a bunch of tubes placed around a vehicle that shoot a large batch of metal balls. Or maybe just one single large gun, again placed on the top center with a turret system That shoots a similar projectile. I actually seen a video of a Russian buggy that used a similar device. It had a couple tubes placed on the front sides of the vehicle That shoot a bunch of metal balls straight up into the air.",

The pressure that would push the drone away would probably cause it to detonate at an ideal range and height if it isn't prevented from exploding. If it was prevented from exploding, the FPV maker would adjust with thinner wires making it more reactive to touch",

Also, I for one greatly appreciate the work you do to maintain your channel and show the clips you glean from Telegram. I've attempted to find these clips as well and I know just how much of a pain in the rear they are to find. I have an appreciation for this hard work. and I might consider the job you are offering but alas, I am not up to the task since I have a great deal of difficulty staying awake for extended periods of time  mostly due to my age, but I am also physically and mildly mentally disabled that would place me as an unsuitable candidate for the position you are looking to fill. But hang in there friend, you will eventually find someone to fill the position and give you a hand to lessen your work burden. You do an excellent job at it, since of most of the videos of the conflict I've seen, yours is the most coherent and is easily understandable. Keep up the fantastic work. I wish you all the best, since YouTube seems to be crashing down on most channels that are showing the war in Ukraine, as well as videos exposing the Chinese for the hypocrites they are, and showing their horrible behavior to the world. People like you are needed badly and if YouTube cracks down on your channel, I recommend Pepperbox as an alternative since they were started by people who have been constantly under attack from YouTube and I know you'd be welcomed there and would have much less restrictions on your content, if any at all, since the service does not support censorship but freedom to produce content that will not be edited for the \"delicate Snowflakes\" out there who cannot stand to see anything that might be considered offensive. thank you for showing the war the Ukrainians are fighting to maintain their freedom and gain their territory back. I have liked, subscribed AND shared this video on Facebook in support of your channel. best wishes.",

This is very rare those days so thank you for your efforts in providing a more balanced covering of the war, if only from tactical and strategic points of view. Some feedback about your video format: add more 'silent space', or visual 'breaks', between disconnected footage as it can be hard sometimes to realize that you've jumped to a different action. Also, in reference to 31:30 and as per the Third Geneva Convention of 1949, it is prohibited to \"expose POWs to public curiosity\". Exposure to public curiosity covers the simple disclosure of images of POWs and recordings of interrogations. Even if POWs appear to make voluntary public statements or willingly participate in the recording of images, disclosure to the public remains unlawful. Thus I would invite you to blur their faces and passport details should you wish to keep on showing them [full disclosure: I do find it interesting to see confirmation of Chinese and North Korean soldiers fighting for the Russian army].",

Most of the footage of these point blank shots show no signs of life at all within or right outside the APCs. I am not hating on Ukraine but theyre known for propaganda just the sane as russia. The footage of suicidal russians in APCs zooming directly at a tank is giving signs those APCs are remotely being controlled.

They are not negotiable in Putin's plan, based on Putin's actions and his ever-lying words.

Europe needs something entirely different. It is beneficial for France, Germany, and the United Kingdom that this conflict continues for some time, preferably involving Trump and turning the war into a kind of \"Trump's war.\" This is the fundamental position of these countries.\n\nIt seemed that some progress was made along this path in April, but so far the progress remains incomplete.\n\nEurope\u2019s strategic objective is more global and even intuitive. In my opinion, Europe senses that in the transitional period from the old world of globalization to the new world of nation-states and civilizations, it is becoming something of a scapegoat. Europe is losing its geopolitical and geoeconomic influence, and the quality of life of its citizens is declining.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Europe is trying with all its might to cling to the old models of the world\u2014often at the cost of Ukrainian lives. For Ukraine, the choice is significantly more difficult and painful.",

America knows very well that Pakistan won't going to return the money. America knows very well that Pakistan will strengthen Terrorism and China. Pakistan has/had successfully fool World and America many times. Or maybe America is partner in crime. Or America thinks that Pakistan will buy Weapons from America and it will benifits Weapons Manufacturing companies. \n\nPakistan will probably use the money against India, Balochistan, Isreal, Britain and Afghanistan. \n\nWhy Britain? Britain has very high Pakistani Immigrant. Pakistanis sees Britain as Muslim majority country with Pakistani influence in future. Britain has probably highest numbers of Pakistani Sleeper cells. Entire Europe has very low population growth and Europe has been highly dependent on Muslim Immigrant. Many Politician has already fall trap into dirty game. Entire Europe is under threat, they failed to maintain a healthy management of Human Resource \n\nIsreal: Hatred against Isreal and India gives Electoral benifits in Pakistan. Action against Isreal gives hero status for Pakistani Army and its terrorist ecosystem. \n\nChina: China is one of the most Irresponsible and dangerous country in the World. It's alleged that China uses Pakistan to disturb India and China uses North Korea to disturb Japan and South Korea. It's alleged that both Pakistan and North Korea gets Nuclear Weapon Technology and Missile Technology from China. Many countries with higher education and higher economic stability failed to develop Nuclear Weapon Technology but both Pakistan and North Korea gets it from Irresponsible and mentally unstable China. Both Pakistan and North Korea share border with China. China doesn't directly attack other countries as it will impect trade relationship so they are choosing mentally unstable countries who can act as per China's directive. Not only Pakistan and North Korea, they are targeting lots of other countries like Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Maldives, some African countries etc. \n\nAmerica: America has obsessed with Weapons. In America more people died on their own Citizen then terrorist attack. It's alleged that America and some other Weapon manufacturing countries are one of biggest contributors of Terrorism. Terrorist don't have Arms manufacturing units. There are very few illegal Arms manufacturing units in the World. It's tough to kill each and every terrorist but its easy to locate Arms manufacturing units and destroy it. Arms manufacturing units needs high Vehicle movement, lots of supplier, bigger manufacturing space. Yes there are smaller Arms manufacturing units but they can't fulfill demand of World Terrorism or Criminal Industry. Most UN security Council members fool people on World's peace?\n\nPeople should rise up and stop IMF aid to Pakistan otherwise ready to face Terrorism? In future all 5 continents might see Islamic aggression. Yes some people might term it as Islamophobia to divert reality but Sadly it is reality? If Muslim population increase in Europe and America, people will see ground reality.",

UK's Boris Johnson rolled it then. \nThere have been several rounds of peace talks to end the Russian invasion of Ukraine since it began in February 2022. Russia's president Vladimir Putin seeks recognition of all occupied land as Russian, for Russia to be given all of the regions it claims but does not fully control, guarantees that Ukraine will never join NATO, and the lifting of sanctions against Russia. Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy seeks a full withdrawal of Russian troops, the return of prisoners and kidnapped Ukrainian children, prosecution of Russian leaders for war crimes, and security guarantees to prevent further Russian aggression.\r\nThe first meeting between Russian and Ukrainian officials took place four days after the invasion began, on 28 February 2022, in Belarus, and concluded without result. Later rounds of talks took place in March 2022 on the Belarus\u2013Ukraine border and in Antalya, Turkey. Negotiations in Turkey created an agreement in which Ukraine would abandon plans to join NATO and have limits placed on its military, while having security guarantees from Western countries, and not being required to recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea. The draft treaty was almost agreed to, but disagreements over security guarantees and the Bucha massacre ultimately halted negotiations.",

    "description": "It looks like something out of science fiction but is in fact terrifyingly real - a robot dog being used by the Ukrainians to help fight the Russians. The Khartiia Brigade, which considers itself a model unit for the future Ukrainian army, has employed the dog on combat missions as a scout, using it to navigate minefields and map enemy trenches. \r\n\r\nBut this is just the beginning - already, some people are experimenting with attaching weapons to it, and integrating AI would allow the dog to identify and attack its own targets. Which begs the question: Is this the future of war? Allow War on Tape to explain.\r\n\r\n#warontape #russia #ukraine #dailymail #military #robotics \r\n \r\nDaily Mail Website: https://www.dailymail.co.uk\r\nDaily Mail Facebook: https://facebook.com/dailymail\r\nDaily Mail IG: https://instagram.com/dailymail\r\nDaily Mail Snap: https://snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Ma...\r\nDaily Mail Twitter: https://twitter.com/MailOnline\r\n\r\nDaily Mail Pinterest: https://pinterest.co.uk/dailymail\r\n \r\nGet the free Daily Mail mobile app: https://dailymail.co.uk/mobile",

        "text": "Regardless of this Geopolitical mess, Ukraine continues to show impressive levels of innovation. They've Adapted & possess a crazy level of Ingenuity. They've developed their own Drone & Robotic technology from the ground up. The fact Ukraine has been able to successfully hold off this Russian invasion at all, is a WIN in my book. They destroyed a large percent of Russia's navy, even tho Ukraine doesn't have a Navy, That's a Win in my book! They are dedicated to protecting their homeland from this invasion. Ukrainians have my utmost respect.\n\nIt's always been a dream of Russia to weaken America from the inside. From Russia's perspective all of that internal instability makes Democracy's & Capitalism look like a complete Joke and a Broken Mess of a System.\nAll of this internal instability has to be making Putin so happy. Russia now has a US administration that is actually full on sympathetic towards Russia. \nAmerica & our allies used to have die hard mindsets such as: \"If Russia invaded another country & started bombing civilians & destroying their cities\" We would have ZERO HESITATION about handling that with violence & force! Yet this current administration seems to no longer share the same core values that America has always stood for. This level of depravity Russia has committed these last years is horrifying. The world cannot let Russia continue to do this. They've committed a disgusting amount of Atrocities. Daily War crimes. Daily Bombing of Ukrainian cities. They blatantly target civilians. The world must punish Russia. We aren't seeing any of this covered in the news here in America? I'm absolutely ashamed of the way my country has behaved. This current administration has betrayed Ukraine and It makes me sick. \nI'm just glad that you are covering what you are because none of this gets any coverage here in the US news channels anymore. It's so messed up. This is such an important conflict yet our governments administration has basically made it vanish here in America. Ukraine is defending their homeland from an unprovoked Russian invasion. Events like this are exactly why organizations like NATO & the UN & the EU even exist. So why are they not doing anything. They can't just let Russia continue to act like this.. \n This is the most intense conflict that has occurred on European soil since WW2.",

    "description": "When Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine back in 2022, the world stood by in terror as the initial fear was that the capital Kyiv, and then the country, might fall in a matter of days. This was due to a variety of factors including a much smaller military, economy, and less advanced equipment than what the Russian military initially possessed. But Ukraine proved the world wrong. So, with all that has happened since then, how do Ukraine and Russia compare with each other now 2 years into this bloody conflict?

What I am getting on is- people do not take responsibility for their actions and think they get a free pass on assaulting people just because they can post it only. Do not let that get to you.

In the face of Russia's increasing attacks, Ukraine never thought of establishing a bargaining table with Russia. Because the USA and the UK said that they would provide unlimited military ammunition and material support to Ukraine in case of war.\n\nBut 1 year after the war started, the USA cut off aid. Because the U.S. Congress wanted it that way. After encouraging Ukraine to go to war, the USA's response to Ukraine at a time when military ammunition was most needed was \"the shop is closed\"!!\nAlthough it is claimed that a lot of aid has been provided, this does not reflect the truth. The only most important aid that works is Patriot missiles. The weapons sent by many EU member countries are scrap and garbage!! Some EU countries, such as Greece, Bulgaria, etc., which have old Soviet-made weapons and equipment in their inventories, sent ammunition and weapons to Ukraine that were expired, had no military value and had to be destroyed and removed from the inventory. Currently, Ukraine has turned into a dump with hundreds of types of old weapons and ammunition that have lost their destructive power.\nThere are a few major countries that currently send weapons.\nEven though it has been 2 years since the war started, there are no F-16s yet!!\nGermany refuses to provide missile aid with the excuse that its range is 500 km. Because he is worried that Ukraine may attack Russian cities with those missiles.\nEurope's monetary aid is generally used to pay salaries and for civilian needs. Some useful weapons aid loses its meaning because it is not provided on time.\nThese people are in the middle of a war. In the harsh winter of Eastern Europe, they are trying to hunt the enemy, wrapped in the icy iron of machine guns. They are about to run out of ammunition. There is a war full of empty promises and so-called supporters who cannot find 155 mm artillery shells.\nBiden cannot send the weapons he promised because he could not convince a few Republican senators!! Germany does not send missiles because it is afraid of Russia. The weapon containers that many countries boast about in the media are outdated inventory residues from the cold war period...!\n\nI also recommend you to look at it from this window. Respects..",

We are told that the war makes NATO stronger when in fact it is depleting it. We are told that Ukraine\u2019s biggest problem is a lack of funds from the U.S. Congress when in fact the West can\u2019t produce enough ammunition \u2014 a problem that will take years to fix. We are told that Russia is suffering greater casualties when in fact Ukraine is running out of soldiers \u2014 another problem money can\u2019t fix. \n\nWe are told that the world is with us when in fact the Global Majority believes U.S. policy is the height of folly. We are told that there is no opportunity to make peace when in fact we have rejected multiple opportunities for a negotiated settlement. We are told that if Ukraine keeps fighting, it will improve its negotiating position when in fact the terms will only get much worse than what was already available and rejected.\n\nNevertheless the lies will succeed in dragging out the war. Congress will appropriate more funds. Russia will take more territory. Ukraine will mobilize more young men and women to feed into the meat grinder. Discontent will mount. Eventually there will be a crisis in Kiev and the Zelensky government will be toppled. \n\nAnd then, when the war is finally lost, when the whole country lays in smoldering ruins on a funeral pyre of their own making, the liars will say \u201cwell we tried.\u201d Having prevented any alternative, having smeared anyone who told the truth as puppets for the enemy, the liars will say \u201cWe did our best. We stood up to Putin.\u201d \n\nIn fact, they will claim, we would have succeeded but for the fifth column of Putin apologists who stabbed the Ukrainians in the back. Then, having shifted blame and patted themselves on the back, they will blithely move on to the next war, as they moved onto Ukraine after their disasters in Afghanistan and Iraq. \n\nThe lies are comprehensive \u2014 but they will work.\u201d\n\nAnyone disagree with this statement?",

However, the world should remember that we have been in a desperate need of the promised artillery missiles for the past 3 months and that is getting terrible. \n\nthe video definitely gives the right idea of huge loses and main features of the combat actions, but I can feel the inaccuracy in details. thank you for keeping this topic alive, though. it is vital for my nation to be seen now. I feel an anxiety rush every time i think of the delayed missiles and all of my friends at the frontline.

For the next counter offensive, ukraine will have f-16s to both contest air superiority to russia and provide air support to ground units, so it should be less difficult to push through russian trenches. If a hole is made into russian defense, ukraine should send through fast vehicles, such as amx-10 and APCs, and fight behind the russian line; it should force russians to moove backward to keep cohesion. If Ukraine takes Tokmak, it should become possible to establish fire control over russian logistical lines with himars. Then, Ukraine will perhaps need time to take back the whole ot kherson region and Crimea, but it should be possible to achieve. Howether, it is possible for Ukraine to chose other ways. Anyway, the f-16 should change the situation in favor to Ukraine.\nAlso, the way Russia fights is heavily based on attrition, but it exposes Russia to attrition too. If Ukraine cares the lives of its soldiers and adapts its tactics, against russias attritional way, it should favor Ukraine as it will have less attrition on its side, wich should free a small mass of manoeuvre.",

Now all they have to follow is Zhukov's strategy - concentrate in one point like 10:1, break through, exploit it, and move into another key point. They have done it in Bakhmut, and now in Avdiivka, and they're planning to do the same in at least 4 different points just this spring.\nWhatever Ukraine is doing, it won't be enough. The US stopping to supply more shells will just speed up the collapse. Russia can sustain this war basically forever, or at least for 10-15 years.\nSo yeah, unless someone has another gamechanger idea, Ukraine will fall. And then the Baltics, probably with minimal fighting, and then Moldova, Romania, Poland, Slovakia, and so on. NATO is strong together - but the member states each have a ridiculously small army. So if Russia can stop interference, for example with nuclear threats (or the actual use of nuclear weapons), then it can realistically conquer at least the Cold War Soviet hegemony.",

Ridiculous. Back in the day, in English classes, people had to be able to discern what is opinion and what is fact, instead of stating basically everything as \"fact\", when actually such is only fact that something is or is not an opinion. Facts can't be wrong, but opinions can and are often wrong, hence why the word opinion equates to what what thinks, not whether if what one thinks about something is factual in the physical realm, aside from the physical brain.

I must have my maths wrong - or Infographics have got their knickers in a twist doing their calculations - but I reckon a tenth of 148 is about 15 - which makes it more extraordinary still that Russia has destroyed 77. ....I know Ukraine used to be a Soviet Republic - but I propose that Ukrainians stopped doing Soviet style maths over 30 years ago...",

Then the 'accidental' shooting down of the Wagner leaders plane and subsequent break up of Wagner? \n\nAvdiivka has been critical politically for Putin because of the upcoming Russian 'elections'. This is already a week out of date because Ukraine withdrew from there in order to minimise casualties from the Russian strategy of 'meat wave' attacks and the urban warfare casualties that would have been unavoidable.\n\nAlso the difference in strategy? Russia, with a superior quantity, but less accurate missiles, illegally targeting civilian populations including schools, hospitals and power stations, grain silos and infrastructure etc, versus Ukraine's more accurate striking of military targets? \n\nWhat about the prevention of a Ukrainian attack against a valid Russian military target by Elon Musk? An unprecedented interference by an individual and private company in a war between 2 nation states.\n\nRussian military has a history of targeting civilians, as proven in Syria when they helped the dictator Assad.\n\nLastly, the main reason that Ukraine has only made limited gains over the last year is because the US has not provided a fraction of what is required to do anything more than defend. As soon as the house of representatives in America gets sorted out, Ukraine will hopefully get the help it needs to expel the Russian aggressors. \n\nPer GDP, European countries have done more than most to help support Ukraine, because they know they will be next if Ukraine falls.",

For example, Germany in WW2 loss over 34% of its military man power up to the point of Stalingrad and started loosing the war since that point. If at 34% Germany was able to fight on til 1945 and still loose it would be statistically impossible at an 87% for any military to muster forces even less conduct any form of training to replace losses. \nBottom line is this is just not accurate although Russia has loss a lot of men the fact is Russia\u2019s military is still alive and functioning even away from the front line. \nUkraine, on the other hand is not able to replace its losses and each loss is now precious to them. Ukraine is going to need assistance and intervention at some point if it wishes to fight on .",

A month earlier, Beria had sent a letter to the Politburo, the governing body of the Soviet Union. In it he proposed the secret shooting of more than 25,000 prisoners of war, mostly from Poland, without any trial. These people are \"declared and hopeless enemies of Soviet power,\" Beria wrote. The Politburo headed by Joseph Stalin endorsed the proposal in writing on March 5 of that year. Almost 22,000 Poles fell victim to the mass murder over the next six weeks. Most of them were shot in the neck and their bodies were buried in previously dug mass graves. More than 4,000 prisoners were murdered in the Katy\u0144 Forest near the city of Smolensk (now Russia), and everyone else in at least four other locations, including Pjatikhatki near the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkov and Kuropaty near Minsk. The NKVD commanders of the individual POW camps had all the personal files of the murdered destroyed. The beasts then as now criminals against humanity.",
