The massive assault left several districts in ruins, forcing residents to take shelter in subway stations. Debris from intercepted and missed missiles caused widespread destruction — with smoke rising across six areas of the city. Tragically, innocent lives were lost, and children are among the injured.\nThis escalation comes just after a prisoner exchange deal that was seen as a hopeful step toward ceasefire. However, the renewed aggression casts doubt on the peace process.\nThe attack also drew international reactions. Former U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been engaged in back-channel negotiations to help end the war, publicly condemned Putin for the assault on Kyiv\n\n#russiaukrainewar\n#kyivbombing\n#trumpcondemnsputin\n#ukrainenews\n#putinattack\n#worldnewstoday\n#breakingnews\n#ukrainecrisis\n#russianmissilestrike\n\nWelcome to Indiatimes Youtube channel.\nYour go-to source for news that matters.

        "description": "#Kanal13​ #likekanal13​ #subscribekanal13 #warinukraine\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1 - SUBSCRIBE TO US!\nRussian dictator Vladimir Putin has three to four months to use his last chance to occupy Ukrainian territories as much as possible. In the meantime, two groups of influence have formed in his entourage, which are trying to advance their interests related to the war in Ukraine.\n\nMilitary analyst and director of the New Geopolitics Research Network platform Mikhail Samus spoke about this in an interview with Telegraf . He explained what options for the development of events are being offered to Putin.\n\n “There is a group of FSB businesses headed by Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, which, through Vitkoff and Jared Kushner, is proposing to the US the idea of a ceasefire, freezing the war and starting a big business between the US and Russia. They are promising big profits to American businesses close to Trump”, says the military expert.\n\nIn his opinion, this will be billions of dollars from the sale of Russian gas to Europe under the American label, diamond mining in Yakutia, Arctic projects, etc. “All this is huge money for specific people. And there are people in Russia who would like to go down this path. This is, first of all, big business, Putin's oligarchy, which lost a lot from the war, and they would like to return to this money that can be earned on Russian resources”, explains the director of the New Geopolitics Research Network.\n\nAccording to him, there is another group that now has a dominant position. This is the \"old guard\": Patrushev, Kiriyenko, Vaino, Chemezov, who are doing business on the war.\n\n\"They have trillion-dollar budgets for war, and they are spending them. Why does Sergey Chemezov, CEO of the Rostec corporation” need a ceasefire now if his military contracts are already written down for a year in advance? If there is a freeze on the war, the military budget will be reduced,\" the analyst notes.\n\nHe recalled experts' predictions that when the war in Ukraine freezes, the Russians will continue to build up their potential and then prepare for war with Europe.\nhttp://youtube.com/kanal13az/join - click here and support Kanal13 monthly for distributing more videos and independent journalism\n\nhttp://t.me/kanal13tv & https://bit.ly/37BVMqU \nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1\nhttps://bit.ly/2Rs6MB3 \n#lastminutenewsfromukraine #kanal13ukraine  \nhttps://bit.ly/2V19Fdy\n\nClick here and just subscribe to Kanal13 - https://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/KANAL13AZ/join\n*ATTENTION: If you woul like to contact with US please, write to +49176 75077516 WhatsApp\n\n▌▌►Website: http://kanal13.tv/\nhttp://www.facebook.com/tvkanal13\nhttps://twitter.com/Kanal13Az\nhttps://www.instagram.com/kanal13.az\n\nClick & Subscribe to the main youtube Channel\n\n© KANAL13 [ Azərbaycanın ilk peşəkar internet televiziyası ] The First Internet TV of Azerbaijan\n\nTags: #Ukriane, #Russia, #Putin, #Putler, #Russian invasion of Ukraine, #Zelenski, #Kiev, #Kyiv, #Kadirov army, #Kadirov, #Kherson, #Bucha, #Kharkiv, #Ukrainian pilots, #vagners, #Russian tanks, #NATO, #drones, #Moscow, #Kreml, #war victims #Ukraina, News, The Washington Post, waPo Video, Washington Post Video, Washington Post YouTube, a:politics, aid, biden, putin, s:Politics, support, t:Other, Ukraine, war, fact check, news coverage, Donald Trump, news, wp video, forbes, nytimes, newspaper, media, journalism, Ilham Aliyev, Baku, Azerbaijan, Israel, Gaza, Palestine, Tel-Aviv, Garabag, Karabakh, football, ronaldo, messi, brian tyler cohen",

In this video, we dive into the fierce battles around Kharkiv—where Ukrainian brigades destroyed multiple Russian armored units—and the secretive partisan raids shaking Russia’s Bryansk region. Discover how Ukraine’s strategic use of drones, multi-layered defenses, and cross-border raids are reshaping the conflict, leaving the Kremlin’s ambitions unrealized.\n\nWe also explore Russia’s push to establish a “security buffer zone,” why Moscow’s goals in the disputed territories remain unmet, and the staggering human and material cost behind every square kilometer gained. From false starts in Belgorod to risky incursions near Kursk, learn why the frontline has become bigger than any one region, as this war transforms into a contest of will, resources, and technology.\n\n#ukrainewarupdate  #ukrainewarmap #military",

With precision drone strikes, mined routes, and artillery ambushes, Ukraine is turning Putin’s attacks into costly failures. Burned-out tanks and abandoned vehicles litter the front lines as Russian forces are funneled into devastating traps. Despite Moscow’s manpower advantage, outdated tactics and failed reforms are leaving troops exposed.

        "description": "Is Russia’s war on Ukraine driving the Kremlin toward economic, military, and social collapse? In this in-depth report, we uncover the May 21 drone attacks that rattled Moscow’s defenses—and how a larger, more strategic strike 400 kilometers away devastated a critical semiconductor factory vital to Russia’s missile and aircraft programs. Beyond the drone raids, we expose the staggering human costs and equipment losses Russia has suffered, the unsustainable militarization of its economy, and the growing gulf between propaganda and reality in Putin’s regime.\n\nFrom drastic government spending on defense to the hidden toll on its workforce and infrastructure, this video reveals why experts predict that Russia’s current path is economically and socially untenable—and why Vladimir Putin appears more isolated and vulnerable than ever. Join us for a comprehensive look at a conflict reshaping global power dynamics and threatening to dismantle the Kremlin’s imperial ambitions from within.\n#ukrainewar #ukrainewarupdate #military #militarydevelopments",

It marked Putin's first visit since Moscow claimed it recaptured Kursk from Ukraininan forces last month. Ukraine's incursion into Kursk in 2024 was the first time a foreign power occupied Russian territory since World War II. \nPresident Putin has not yet accepted US and European ceasefire proposals, stating that the \"root causes of the war\" need to be addressed before negotiations can begin. On Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the motive for a Western-backed truce is for the US and Europe to \"calmly arm Ukraine, so that Ukraine can strengthen its defensive positions\". \n\nDW interviews Michael Kimmage, Historian and Associate Professor at the Catholic University of America. He served on the Policy Planning Staff at the U.S. Department of State between 2014 to 2016, where he held the Russia/Ukraine portfolio.\n\n\n#russiaukrainewar #putin #russiadomesticpolitics\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1",

Drones attacked the Bolkhov factory of semiconductor devices in the Oryol region of the Russian Federation. Photos from the scene of the accident are spreading on social networks: they show a fire and a column of black smoke.\n\nAccording to the Russian Telegram-channels, the company is connected with the military industry and produces components for radio-electronic equipment, including communication systems, control systems, EW, as well as simulators for tanks and missile complexes.\n\nThe plant's products are used by the defense concern \"Sozvezdie\" and other structures of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\nSix UAVs were intercepted and destroyed by electronic warfare and air defense systems in the Moscow region, three over the territory of the Ryazan region, one each in the skies of the Tula and Kaluga regions, and also over the waters of the Black Sea.\n\nThe border regions of Russia were also attacked. The most massive strike of the Ukrainian Armed Forces was in the Bryansk region. The Russian Ministry of Defense reported 51 drones destroyed over the Bryansk region. 36 UAVs were shot down over the Kursk region, and one over the Belgorod region.\n\nThe total number of Ukrainian drones destroyed over Russian regions on May 21 increased by 08:00 Moscow time from 127 to 159 units. No drones were spotted in the Samara Region at the time of publication.

        "title": "Russia launching WWII-style breakthrough in Sumy; Ukrainian snipers mass-kill Russian soldiers here",
        "description": "#Kanal13​ #likekanal13​ #subscribekanal13 #warinukraine\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1 - SUBSCRIBE TO US!\nViktor Bobyrenko, an analyst at the Bureau of Policy and Analysis of Ukraine, believes that the landscape of the Sumy region and the nature of modern warfare will prevent Russian forces from breaking through Ukrainian defenses.\n\"To avoid sparking panic, let me say right away — a large-scale breakthrough in the style of World War II is not possible in Sumy. People here remember 2022, when Russia advanced and was, so to speak, on the outskirts of Sumy by midday. By February 25, the city was sealed off and under siege for a month. Today, there will be no such breakthrough where the enemy reaches Sumy in a day. Warfare is different now.\nIt’s simply not feasible because the terrain between the Siverskyi Donets and Psel rivers is not suited for tanks — it’s full of floodplains and a network of ponds. You can’t maneuver tanks there. However, it’s a paradise for sabotage and reconnaissance groups and snipers: a landscape with forests and woodlands, the edge of the Central Russian highlands,\" the analyst explained on Espreso TV.\nAccording to him, Russian forces might try to use this area as a \"gray zone,\" given reports that Russia has amassed over 60,000 troops nearby. So there could be engagements similar to those near Pokrovsk — advances of maybe 500 meters a day at most. At that pace, it would take them six months to a year to reach Sumy. Therefore, there's no reason to panic about a rapid breakthrough in the region.\n\"Still, Russian artillery can strike up to 20 kilometers deep, as seen in Bilopillia, and FPV drones are active. For instance, on May 17, a minivan was hit by Russian forces just 11 km from the front line on the Sumy–Bilopillia–Putyvl–Hlukhiv–Shostka highway. The railway is nearby too. When a train runs from Sumy to Konotop, it speeds up to pass through this high-risk zone near the border. It’s possible the Russians aim to cut this road, which connects Sumy with communities north of the Siverskyi Donets River. In that sense, they could advance here.\nBut back in 1943, the Red Army advanced elsewhere — around the Pysarivka community, aiming to reach the rear of Kharkiv and sever the Sumy–Kharkiv highway and rail links. That area lies further south than where the current intense fighting is happening,\" Bobyrenko concluded.\nhttp://youtube.com/kanal13az/join - click here and support Kanal13 monthly for distributing more videos and independent journalism\n\nhttp://t.me/kanal13tv & https://bit.ly/37BVMqU \nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1\nhttps://bit.ly/2Rs6MB3 \n#lastminutenewsfromukraine #kanal13ukraine  \nhttps://bit.ly/2V19Fdy\n\nClick here and just subscribe to Kanal13 - https://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/KANAL13AZ/join\n*ATTENTION: If you woul like to contact with US please, write to +49176 75077516 WhatsApp\n\n▌▌►Website: http://kanal13.tv/\nhttp://www.facebook.com/tvkanal13\nhttps://twitter.com/Kanal13Az\nhttps://www.instagram.com/kanal13.az\n\nClick & Subscribe to the main youtube Channel\n\n© KANAL13 [ Azərbaycanın ilk peşəkar internet televiziyası ] The First Internet TV of Azerbaijan\n\nTags: #Ukriane, #Russia, #Putin, #Putler, #Russian invasion of Ukraine, #Zelenski, #Kiev, #Kyiv, #Kadirov army, #Kadirov, #Kherson, #Bucha, #Kharkiv, #Ukrainian pilots, #vagners, #Russian tanks, #NATO, #drones, #Moscow, #Kreml, #war victims #Ukraina, News, The Washington Post, waPo Video, Washington Post Video, Washington Post YouTube, a:politics, aid, biden, putin, s:Politics, support, t:Other, Ukraine, war, fact check, news coverage, Donald Trump, news, wp video, forbes, nytimes, newspaper, media, journalism, Ilham Aliyev, Baku, Azerbaijan, Israel, Gaza, Palestine, Tel-Aviv, Garabag, Karabakh, football, ronaldo, messi, brian tyler cohen",

        "description": "On May 19, Foreign Policy detailed why experts now believe Russia is on the brink of defeat in Ukraine. Since the February 2022 invasion, Russia has lost nearly 976,000 troops to death, injury, or capture and over 10,800 tanks. Territorial gains have declined steadily, with only 55–78 square miles claimed in March 2025.\n\nCompounding these losses is a stagnating Russian economy, with inflation nearing 10% and labor shortages projected to reach 2.4 million workers by 2030. Politically, Putin faces growing pressure as ceasefire negotiations stall and public dissatisfaction rises. As Ukraine begins counter-offensives, experts suggest Russia’s campaign is not just faltering — it may be nearing collapse.\n\nSupport us directly as we bring you independent, up-to-date reporting on military news and global conflicts by clicking here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKfak8fBm_Lhy4eX9UKxEpA/join\n\n#militarystrategy #militarydevelopments #militaryanalysis\n#themilitaryshow\n\nSOURCES: https://pastebin.com/gW6gQa7A",

        "title": "Russia launching WWII-style breakthrough in Sumy; Ukrainian snipers mass-kill Russian soldiers here",
        "description": "#Kanal13​ #likekanal13​ #subscribekanal13 #warinukraine\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1 - SUBSCRIBE TO US!\nViktor Bobyrenko, an analyst at the Bureau of Policy and Analysis of Ukraine, believes that the landscape of the Sumy region and the nature of modern warfare will prevent Russian forces from breaking through Ukrainian defenses.\n\"To avoid sparking panic, let me say right away — a large-scale breakthrough in the style of World War II is not possible in Sumy. People here remember 2022, when Russia advanced and was, so to speak, on the outskirts of Sumy by midday. By February 25, the city was sealed off and under siege for a month. Today, there will be no such breakthrough where the enemy reaches Sumy in a day. Warfare is different now.\nIt’s simply not feasible because the terrain between the Siverskyi Donets and Psel rivers is not suited for tanks — it’s full of floodplains and a network of ponds. You can’t maneuver tanks there. However, it’s a paradise for sabotage and reconnaissance groups and snipers: a landscape with forests and woodlands, the edge of the Central Russian highlands,\" the analyst explained on Espreso TV.\nAccording to him, Russian forces might try to use this area as a \"gray zone,\" given reports that Russia has amassed over 60,000 troops nearby. So there could be engagements similar to those near Pokrovsk — advances of maybe 500 meters a day at most. At that pace, it would take them six months to a year to reach Sumy. Therefore, there's no reason to panic about a rapid breakthrough in the region.\n\"Still, Russian artillery can strike up to 20 kilometers deep, as seen in Bilopillia, and FPV drones are active. For instance, on May 17, a minivan was hit by Russian forces just 11 km from the front line on the Sumy–Bilopillia–Putyvl–Hlukhiv–Shostka highway. The railway is nearby too. When a train runs from Sumy to Konotop, it speeds up to pass through this high-risk zone near the border. It’s possible the Russians aim to cut this road, which connects Sumy with communities north of the Siverskyi Donets River. In that sense, they could advance here.\nBut back in 1943, the Red Army advanced elsewhere — around the Pysarivka community, aiming to reach the rear of Kharkiv and sever the Sumy–Kharkiv highway and rail links. That area lies further south than where the current intense fighting is happening,\" Bobyrenko concluded.\nhttp://youtube.com/kanal13az/join - click here and support Kanal13 monthly for distributing more videos and independent journalism\n\nhttp://t.me/kanal13tv & https://bit.ly/37BVMqU \nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1\nhttps://bit.ly/2Rs6MB3 \n#lastminutenewsfromukraine #kanal13ukraine  \nhttps://bit.ly/2V19Fdy\n\nClick here and just subscribe to Kanal13 - https://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/KANAL13AZ/join\n*ATTENTION: If you woul like to contact with US please, write to +49176 75077516 WhatsApp\n\n▌▌►Website: http://kanal13.tv/\nhttp://www.facebook.com/tvkanal13\nhttps://twitter.com/Kanal13Az\nhttps://www.instagram.com/kanal13.az\n\nClick & Subscribe to the main youtube Channel\n\n© KANAL13 [ Azərbaycanın ilk peşəkar internet televiziyası ] The First Internet TV of Azerbaijan\n\nTags: #Ukriane, #Russia, #Putin, #Putler, #Russian invasion of Ukraine, #Zelenski, #Kiev, #Kyiv, #Kadirov army, #Kadirov, #Kherson, #Bucha, #Kharkiv, #Ukrainian pilots, #vagners, #Russian tanks, #NATO, #drones, #Moscow, #Kreml, #war victims #Ukraina, News, The Washington Post, waPo Video, Washington Post Video, Washington Post YouTube, a:politics, aid, biden, putin, s:Politics, support, t:Other, Ukraine, war, fact check, news coverage, Donald Trump, news, wp video, forbes, nytimes, newspaper, media, journalism, Ilham Aliyev, Baku, Azerbaijan, Israel, Gaza, Palestine, Tel-Aviv, Garabag, Karabakh, football, ronaldo, messi, brian tyler cohen",

        "description": "On May 19, Foreign Policy detailed why experts now believe Russia is on the brink of defeat in Ukraine. Since the February 2022 invasion, Russia has lost nearly 976,000 troops to death, injury, or capture and over 10,800 tanks. Territorial gains have declined steadily, with only 55–78 square miles claimed in March 2025.\n\nCompounding these losses is a stagnating Russian economy, with inflation nearing 10% and labor shortages projected to reach 2.4 million workers by 2030. Politically, Putin faces growing pressure as ceasefire negotiations stall and public dissatisfaction rises. As Ukraine begins counter-offensives, experts suggest Russia’s campaign is not just faltering — it may be nearing collapse.\n\nSupport us directly as we bring you independent, up-to-date reporting on military news and global conflicts by clicking here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKfak8fBm_Lhy4eX9UKxEpA/join\n\n#militarystrategy #militarydevelopments #militaryanalysis\n#themilitaryshow\n\nSOURCES: https://pastebin.com/gW6gQa7A",

        "title": "Russian strategic aviation aircraft suffer more losses as result of Ukrainian long-range UAV strikes",
        "description": "#Kanal13​ #likekanal13​ #subscribekanal13 #warinukraine\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1 - SUBSCRIBE TO US!\nRussia is moving its strategic aviation aircraft away from Ukraine because it cannot repair them after long-range UAV strikes . This was reported on air by Anatoly Khrapchinsky, deputy general director of the company producing electronic warfare equipment and aviation expert, on Radio NV .\n\n\"The enemy doesn't have such problems with tactical aviation. Therefore, he can neglect safety rules a little. Increasing the capacity to produce long-range drones will allow us to turn the 300-kilometer zone around the borders of Ukraine into the so-called Chernobaivka. And it is important to do this so that the enemy simply cannot be at these airfields. When they just start to deploy, the strikes begin,\" Khrapchinsky said.\n\nHe added that this would significantly increase the logistical leverage for the Russians and deprive them of operational speed in some areas of the front.\n\nIn addition, the expert explained why the Russians began to draw silhouettes of airplanes on their airfields.\n\n\"The Russians understand the threats and are trying to increase the number by drawing. It is difficult to say what they are counting on. After all, what we use as attack UAVs allows us to distinguish whether it is a drawing or a real aircraft. As I understand it, this is so that the technical personnel at the airfield have something to do,\" Khrapchinsky added.\n\nRecall, , on the night of January 20, 2025, long-range kamikaze drones from Ukraine’s Defense Forces struck the Kazan Aircraft Production Association , which manufactures Tu-22M3 and Tu-160 strategic bombers.\n\nTo begin with, russia is currently incapable of manufacturing entirely new Tu-160 and Tu-22M3 bombers from scratch. To assemble what are officially labeled as \"new\" aircraft of these types, the russians are forced to use Soviet-era airframes that have been sitting in KAPO workshops for several decades. In russian propaganda terminology, this process is now referred to as \"reproduction\".\n\nRegarding the Tu-160, open sources indicate that, between 2022 and 2023, as part of the \"reproduction\" program, russia assembled three bombers of this type from Soviet airframes, designating them as Tu-160M. Additionally, before February 2022, another operational aircraft of this type had been undergoing modernization at KAPO under the same Tu-160M designation. The paradox is that the russian Ministry of Defense now hopes to commission all four Tu-160Ms, each capable of carrying 12 cruise missiles, into the russian Aerospace Forces by at least 2025—despite the fact that all four aircraft were initially scheduled for delivery in 2023.\nhttp://youtube.com/kanal13az/join - click here and support Kanal13 monthly for distributing more videos and independent journalism\n\nhttp://t.me/kanal13tv & https://bit.ly/37BVMqU \nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1\nhttps://bit.ly/2Rs6MB3 \n#lastminutenewsfromukraine #kanal13ukraine  \nhttps://bit.ly/2V19Fdy\n\nClick here and just subscribe to Kanal13 - https://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/KANAL13AZ/join\n*ATTENTION: If you woul like to contact with US please, write to +49176 75077516 WhatsApp\n\n▌▌►Website: http://kanal13.tv/\nhttp://www.facebook.com/tvkanal13\nhttps://twitter.com/Kanal13Az\nhttps://www.instagram.com/kanal13.az\n\nClick & Subscribe to the main youtube Channel\n\n© KANAL13 [ Azərbaycanın ilk peşəkar internet televiziyası ] The First Internet TV of Azerbaijan\n\nTags: #Ukriane, #Russia, #Putin, #Putler, #Russian invasion of Ukraine, #Zelenski, #Kiev, #Kyiv, #Kadirov army, #Kadirov, #Kherson, #Bucha, #Kharkiv, #Ukrainian pilots, #vagners, #Russian tanks, #NATO, #drones, #Moscow, #Kreml, #war victims #Ukraina, News, The Washington Post, waPo Video, Washington Post Video, Washington Post YouTube, a:politics, aid, biden, putin, s:Politics, support, t:Other, Ukraine, war, fact check, news coverage, Donald Trump, news, wp video, forbes, nytimes, newspaper, media, journalism, Ilham Aliyev, Baku, Azerbaijan, Israel, Gaza, Palestine, Tel-Aviv, Garabag, Karabakh, football, ronaldo, messi, brian tyler cohen",

With precision drone strikes, mined routes, and artillery ambushes, Ukraine is turning Putin’s attacks into costly failures. Burned-out tanks and abandoned vehicles litter the front lines as Russian forces are funneled into devastating traps. Despite Moscow’s manpower advantage, outdated tactics and failed reforms are leaving troops exposed.

        "description": "Is Russia’s war on Ukraine driving the Kremlin toward economic, military, and social collapse? In this in-depth report, we uncover the May 21 drone attacks that rattled Moscow’s defenses—and how a larger, more strategic strike 400 kilometers away devastated a critical semiconductor factory vital to Russia’s missile and aircraft programs. Beyond the drone raids, we expose the staggering human costs and equipment losses Russia has suffered, the unsustainable militarization of its economy, and the growing gulf between propaganda and reality in Putin’s regime.\n\nFrom drastic government spending on defense to the hidden toll on its workforce and infrastructure, this video reveals why experts predict that Russia’s current path is economically and socially untenable—and why Vladimir Putin appears more isolated and vulnerable than ever. Join us for a comprehensive look at a conflict reshaping global power dynamics and threatening to dismantle the Kremlin’s imperial ambitions from within.\n#ukrainewar #ukrainewarupdate #military #militarydevelopments",

        "description": "On Wednesday, the Kremin announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin had visited Russia's Kursk region on Tuesday. It marked Putin's first visit since Moscow claimed it recaptured Kursk from Ukraininan forces last month. Ukraine's incursion into Kursk in 2024 was the first time a foreign power occupied Russian territory since World War II. \nPresident Putin has not yet accepted US and European ceasefire proposals, stating that the \"root causes of the war\" need to be addressed before negotiations can begin. On Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the motive for a Western-backed truce is for the US and Europe to \"calmly arm Ukraine, so that Ukraine can strengthen its defensive positions\". \n\nDW interviews Michael Kimmage, Historian and Associate Professor at the Catholic University of America. He served on the Policy Planning Staff at the U.S. Department of State between 2014 to 2016, where he held the Russia/Ukraine portfolio.\n\n\n#russiaukrainewar #putin #russiadomesticpolitics\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1",

        "description": "#Kanal13​ #likekanal13​ #subscribekanal13 #warinukraine\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1 - SUBSCRIBE TO US!\nViktor Bobyrenko, an analyst at the Bureau of Policy and Analysis of Ukraine, believes that the landscape of the Sumy region and the nature of modern warfare will prevent Russian forces from breaking through Ukrainian defenses.\n\"To avoid sparking panic, let me say right away — a large-scale breakthrough in the style of World War II is not possible in Sumy. People here remember 2022, when Russia advanced and was, so to speak, on the outskirts of Sumy by midday. By February 25, the city was sealed off and under siege for a month. Today, there will be no such breakthrough where the enemy reaches Sumy in a day. Warfare is different now.\nIt’s simply not feasible because the terrain between the Siverskyi Donets and Psel rivers is not suited for tanks — it’s full of floodplains and a network of ponds. You can’t maneuver tanks there. However, it’s a paradise for sabotage and reconnaissance groups and snipers: a landscape with forests and woodlands, the edge of the Central Russian highlands,\" the analyst explained on Espreso TV.\nAccording to him, Russian forces might try to use this area as a \"gray zone,\" given reports that Russia has amassed over 60,000 troops nearby. So there could be engagements similar to those near Pokrovsk — advances of maybe 500 meters a day at most. At that pace, it would take them six months to a year to reach Sumy. Therefore, there's no reason to panic about a rapid breakthrough in the region.\n\"Still, Russian artillery can strike up to 20 kilometers deep, as seen in Bilopillia, and FPV drones are active. For instance, on May 17, a minivan was hit by Russian forces just 11 km from the front line on the Sumy–Bilopillia–Putyvl–Hlukhiv–Shostka highway. The railway is nearby too. When a train runs from Sumy to Konotop, it speeds up to pass through this high-risk zone near the border. It’s possible the Russians aim to cut this road, which connects Sumy with communities north of the Siverskyi Donets River. In that sense, they could advance here.\nBut back in 1943, the Red Army advanced elsewhere — around the Pysarivka community, aiming to reach the rear of Kharkiv and sever the Sumy–Kharkiv highway and rail links. That area lies further south than where the current intense fighting is happening,\" Bobyrenko concluded.\nhttp://youtube.com/kanal13az/join - click here and support Kanal13 monthly for distributing more videos and independent journalism\n\nhttp://t.me/kanal13tv & https://bit.ly/37BVMqU \nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1\nhttps://bit.ly/2Rs6MB3 \n#lastminutenewsfromukraine #kanal13ukraine  \nhttps://bit.ly/2V19Fdy\n\nClick here and just subscribe to Kanal13 - https://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/KANAL13AZ/join\n*ATTENTION: If you woul like to contact with US please, write to +49176 75077516 WhatsApp\n\n▌▌►Website: http://kanal13.tv/\nhttp://www.facebook.com/tvkanal13\nhttps://twitter.com/Kanal13Az\nhttps://www.instagram.com/kanal13.az\n\nClick & Subscribe to the main youtube Channel\n\n© KANAL13 [ Azərbaycanın ilk peşəkar internet televiziyası ] The First Internet TV of Azerbaijan\n\nTags: #Ukriane, #Russia, #Putin, #Putler, #Russian invasion of Ukraine, #Zelenski, #Kiev, #Kyiv, #Kadirov army, #Kadirov, #Kherson, #Bucha, #Kharkiv, #Ukrainian pilots, #vagners, #Russian tanks, #NATO, #drones, #Moscow, #Kreml, #war victims #Ukraina, News, The Washington Post, waPo Video, Washington Post Video, Washington Post YouTube, a:politics, aid, biden, putin, s:Politics, support, t:Other, Ukraine, war, fact check, news coverage, Donald Trump, news, wp video, forbes, nytimes, newspaper, media, journalism, Ilham Aliyev, Baku, Azerbaijan, Israel, Gaza, Palestine, Tel-Aviv, Garabag, Karabakh, football, ronaldo, messi, brian tyler cohen",

Subscribe for 40% off unlimited access to world-wide coverage through my link. \n\nKings and Generals animated historical documentary series on modern warfare continues with another video on the Russian Invasion of Ukraine with the updates of April 2025. In this episode, we examine the latest developments in the War in Ukraine as hopes for peace remain elusive as there has been no diplomatic breakthrough despite ongoing discussions and shifting rhetoric. While leaders speak of ceasefires, nothing tangible has materialized on the ground. On the frontlines, our April battlefield overview reveals that Russia continues to press offensives in key areas like Pokrovsk, but with limited gains and high casualties, while Ukraine defends fiercely and launches localized counterattacks. Foreign involvement and support have taken on new dimensions this month. Reports confirm the presence of North Korean troops and even Chinese nationals fighting for Russia, while military aid from Europe expands, contrasting with growing hesitation from the United States. European diplomacy and security guarantees remain uncertain, with shifting tones suggesting that Ukraine may have to rely more heavily on its own forces rather than international peacekeepers. Amidst this, the U.S. peace proposal and reactions have stirred controversy. The Trump administration's suggested deal would recognize some Russian territorial gains, drawing strong opposition from Kyiv and its European allies. As April ends, the conclusion is clear: talks are stalled, the war drags on, and international unity on a resolution remains fragile.\n\nPacific War Series: youtu.be/MEgIHN63ojU?list=PLaBYW76inbX4kE52CPUvx8gZ7CQyjweEg\nModern Warfare series: youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaBYW76inbX4NYr_WkbaW5KfYwqTAxn08\n\n🎥 Watch 210+ exclusive videos on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMmaBzfCCwZ2KqaBJjkj0fw/join\nSupport Kings and Generals:\n✔ Patreon ► https://www.patreon.com/kingsandgenerals\n✔ PayPal ► https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/kingsandgenerals\n✔ Bitcoin (BTC)► bc1qe0a9266ksksncp44flhgrwex5sm94w3y576z7t\n✔ Ethereum (ETH)► 0x6F453dBc50F21816dCe8fdaE797AA9071c8d3a8a\n✔ Merch store ► https://teespring.com/stores/kingsandgenerals\n\nVideo: Leif Sick\nScript: Turgut Gambar\nNarration: Officially Devin\n\n✔ Merch store ► https://teespring.com/stores/kingsandgenerals\n✔ Podcast ► http://www.kingsandgenerals.net/podcast/\n✔ Twitter ► https://twitter.com/KingsGenerals\n✔ Instagram ►http://www.instagram.com/Kings_Generals\n\nProduction Music courtesy of Epidemic Sound: http://www.epidemicsound.com\n\n00:00 – No Diplomatic Breakthrough\n02:46 – April Battlefield Overview\n06:11 – Foreign Involvement and Support\n09:18 – European Diplomacy and Security Guarantees\n12:08 – U.S. Peace Proposal and Reactions\n16:08 – Conclusion: A Stalemate in Talks\n#Documentary #Kursk #Ukraine #UkraineConflict #RussiaUkraine #globalcrisis",

        "description": "Russia Ukraine War Ceasefire: Turkey में मिलेंगे Vladimir Putin- Volodymyr Zelenskyy? | Donald Trump | Russia-Ukraine peace talks in Istanbul | \nRussia Ukraine War Ceasefire : Turkey İstanbul में रूस-यूक्रेन शांति वार्ता के पहले Donald trump ने Putin को दिया ऑफर ? \n\n#russiaukrainewar #vladimirputin #volodymyrzelensky \n\nPeace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul, scheduled for May 15, 2025, mark the first direct high-level negotiations since March 2022, aimed at ending the ongoing war that began with Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Here’s a concise overview based on current developments \nPrevious talks in Istanbul in 2022 produced a draft agreement where Ukraine would adopt neutrality, forgo NATO membership, and limit its military, in exchange for security guarantees from Western nations. These collapsed due to disagreements over security guarantees, the Bucha massacre, and Ukraine’s reluctance to make constitutional changes.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin proposed the talks on May 11, 2025, as a counteroffer to a Western-backed 30-day ceasefire proposal, which he rejected. The Kremlin insists negotiations should build on the 2022 Istanbul draft but reflect current battlefield realities, with Russia controlling about one-fifth of Ukraine, including Crimea and parts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has insisted on meeting Putin face-to-face, stating he will only negotiate with Putin himself, as “only Putin can make the decision to stop the war.” Zelenskyy plans to meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara first, then travel to Istanbul. The Kremlin has not confirmed Putin’s attendance, naming a delegation led by Putin’s aide Vladimir Medinsky, with other lower-level officials, prompting criticism from European leaders and Zelenskyy for Russia’s lack of seriousness.\nU.S. Involvement: U.S. President Donald Trump has prioritized ending the war, urging Zelenskyy to attend the talks. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and envoys Steve Witkoff and Keith Kellogg are in Istanbul, with Trump indicating he might attend if Putin shows up, though he is not expected to as of now.\n\nTurkey’s Role: Turkey, maintaining balanced relations with both nations, is hosting the talks, with Erdogan positioning Turkey as a neutral mediator. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan expressed hope for a “new chapter” in Europe. The talks coincide with a NATO ministerial meeting in Antalya, adding diplomatic weight.\n\nGet all the updates on Political News in the following playlist.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbpSZGZSBY4&list=PLU3m2X_d0hdGCU4Mmurlibcb0DISSKUp-\n(Please Subscribe To News18 MP CG LIVE TV on YouTube For all the Latest Updates)\n\nAbout: \nNews18 MP Chhattisgarh is an exclusive news channel on YouTube which streams news related to MP, Chhattisgarh, Nation, and The World.

The Khartiia Brigade, which considers itself a model unit for the future Ukrainian army, has employed the dog on combat missions as a scout, using it to navigate minefields and map enemy trenches. \n\nBut this is just the beginning - already, some people are experimenting with attaching weapons to it, and integrating AI would allow the dog to identify and attack its own targets.

        "title": "Russian “Victory Parade” Assault TURNS INTO A BRUTAL DEFEAT! | RFU News",
        "description": "🔴 Subscribe to our news website today and unlock exclusive strategic and tactical insights: https://www.rfunews.com/pricing\n\nToday, there is interesting news from the Toretsk direction.\n\nHere, the Russian command was forced to achieve a victory to inspire its troops, so they decided to gamble on another suicidal mission. In a bizarre idea, Russians rode across the fields with soviet flags, while Ukrainians used them simply as target practice.\n\nIn and around the war-torn Toretsk, the Russian military continues to face stiff resistance and heavy losses. Months of attritional warfare have left much of the city in ruins, turning it into a grey zone, an area where neither side can maintain stable control. Amid these conditions, Russian forces have increasingly shifted their focus to bypassing Toretsk by advancing through surrounding settlements such as Shcherbynivka and its adjoining agglomerations. The Russian objective, to flank the town and force a collapse from the sides, after failing to take it head-on over the past year.\n\nThis change in approach follows repeated tactical failures, most notably in Shcherbynivka itself. In earlier offensives, Russian infantry attempted to seize the area, but units from Ukraine’s Azov Corps decisively cleared them out. For the Russians, gaining control here is not optional. Without it, they cannot hope to isolate Ukrainian forces inside Toretsk or protect themselves from raids and fire missions that continue to harass them from the outskirts.  \n\nOn Toretsk’s northern flank, earlier Russian motorcycle assaults failed miserably, as you might remember from a previous report. Ukrainians responded by recalibrating minefields and integrating more layered defenses, effectively neutralizing the threat. Learning little from these failures, Russian commanders turned their attention to the south, hoping this area, not yet targeted with motorcycles, might offer an opportunity for more success. But this time, they wanted something more than a breakthrough and started a spectacular assault.\n\nWhat followed was an attempt at psychological warfare, designed to boost the morale of Russian troops before the launch of their summer offensive. Russian soldiers mounted motorcycles, each flying big Russian and Soviet flags as they charged forward. The move was pure symbolism, an apparent effort to film a triumphant advance through a contested sector to boost morale and deliver some “good news” to the Russian information space. But in practice, these flags served only one real purpose: making the assault troops bigger and more visible targets.\n\nGeolocated footage shows the assault force initially advancing along a single road before splitting into two columns. This maneuver aimed to reduce vulnerability to a single ambush, hoping that at least one group would make it through to their objective. But Ukrainian drone operators were already watching. Alert and experienced, they quickly detected the attackers, and the Ukrainians executed a multi-layered defense with brutal efficiency.\n\nUkrainian artillery opened fire first, followed by FPV drone strikes that chased the motorcycles across the terrain. Other drones hovered above, dropping grenades on the soldiers with pinpoint accuracy. Riders were knocked off their bikes one by one, their flags falling beside them into the dust. \n\nDespite the initial barrage, a handful of motorcyclists did manage to escape the first engagement, crawling into the ruins of nearby buildings with the hope of finding cover. Ukrainian forces responded with cluster munitions, saturating the hiding spots with shrapnel. Simultaneously, more drones were deployed, systematically eliminating the surviving Russians. By the end, the only remnants of the attack were burning motorcycles and shredded Russian flags around them.\n\nThis failed assault, rather than delivering a morale-boosting spectacle for the Russian soldiers preparing for their renewed offensive effort, became a visual demonstration of Ukrainian dominance on the battlefield. Instead of planting flags on Ukrainian positions, the attackers left behind nothing but charred wreckage and more proof of Russia’s inability to make meaningful progress and move away from suicidal tactics.\n\nOverall, the operation underscores the desperation within the Russian command. With no territorial success to show, they gambled on an information victory, trying to craft a narrative of momentum with flags and theatrics. But what they received was a disaster captured in real-time: a symbolic assault turned symbolic defeat. With Russian commanders failing to achieve their victory, Russian soldiers and survivors of the previous failed assaults now stand to launch a massive summer offensive with their hopes even further in the gutter.",

        "title": "New Ukrainian Incendiary Drones Leave Nothing But Ash! | RFU News",
        "description": "🔴 Subscribe to our news website today and unlock exclusive strategic and tactical insights: https://www.rfunews.com/pricing\n\nToday, there are a lot of important updates from the Pokrovsk direction.\n\nHere, a Russian mechanized column barely cleared its staging area before Ukrainian incendiary drones swooped immediately to engage them. The strike caught the vehicles in the open, setting equipment and fuel ablaze in mere minutes before the assault had even started.\n\nThe goal of the Russian forces in this area is to establish a foothold in Myrnograd to initiate large-scale urban combat in the Pokrovsk-Myrnohrad agglomeration. This is because the southern part of Myrnohrad is distant and detached from the core part of the city, where the bulk of Ukrainian forces are stationed, making it more vulnerable to Russian assaults.\n\nTo establish a foothold in Myrnohrad the Russians decided to accumulate forces in Hrodivka from which they would launch a direct mechanized assault towards the town. This is enabled by a 5 kilometer section of a paved asphalt road between Hrodivka and Myrnohrad, allowing the Russian tanks and BMPs to utilize their full speed to reach the city and dismount stormtroopers for urban fighting quickly.\n\nThe main tactical disadvantages of the Russian forces in this area is the industrial zone of the nearby coal mine in the southern part of Myrnohrad, which includes high-rise buildings of mineshaft elevators that provide fortified concrete observation points that overlook the Russian route of attack. Additionally, two elevated terrikons in the area allow for additional observation points to overlook all Russian movements around Myrnohrad, together with firing positions. \n\nForward Ukrainian positions in the fields before the city include two powerful strongholds built in 2015 and heavily reinforced with concrete bunkers, trenches, and dugouts overlooking the Hrodivka road. Any Russian advance along this route faces deadly ATGM fire from these fortifications. To compound the threat, Ukrainian engineers have scattered anti-tank mines across the road, forcing Russian units to slow and use mine rollers on their lead vehicles, which exposes them further to Ukrainian strikes.\n\nTo properly advance and evade Ukrainian fire the Russians would need to maneuver across the fields; however, the Ukrainians anticipated this and built a network of anti-tank ditches and dragon teeth across the fields, effectively turning the Russian road of attack into a killzone. This means that the Russians would be forced to attack Myrnohrad by driving slowly along the paved road and deactivating anti-tank mines, since the surrounding fields are covered with anti-tank ditches and dragon teeth, while the Ukrainians positioned at the terrikon, industrial zone, and trench strongholds have a firing solution on them.\n\nGeolocated combat footage from the area reveals how a Russian mechanized platoon, consisting of a tank and two BMPs, was immediately detected by the Ukrainian forces stationed at observation points as soon as they left Hrodivka and exposed themselves on the road. The lead tank was equipped with a mine roller, with the rest of the convoy moving slowly, meaning that Ukrainians detected them within minutes. As the Russians just started their assault and were not yet within range of Ukrainian soldiers at trenches and terrikon that are armed with ATGM, the Ukrainian FPV drone operators immediately reacted and struck the Russian vehicles engines, effectively immobilizing them. \n\nThis led to a panic among Russian soldiers in the convoy as they thought that they would advance faster if they moved on foot rather than vehicles, only to expose themselves to Ukrainian FPV drones right after leaving their tanks and BMPs, leading to quick eliminations, while others fled to the rear. This left the Russian vehicles abandoned and damaged, but at risk of possible recovery by the nearby Russian forces, so the Ukrainian drone operators targeted open hatches left by the Russian vehicle crews with incendiary drone-dropped grenades that finished them off and blew them up.\n\nOverall, the Russians launched a poorly calculated assault that almost completely ignored the strong networks of fortifications made by the Ukrainians, which forced the Russians in a narrow kill zone where the Ukrainians destroyed an entire mechanized platoon in minutes. This assault is direct result of the intensification of Russian assaults across the Pokrovsk direction, and it is the first Russian mechanized assault here after months of stalemate near Myrnohrad, meaning that attacks here will continue shortly.",

        "description": "Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he'll travel to Turkey on Thursday to take part in peace talks proposed by Russia and he's called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet him in person. \nAfter more than three years of war, Russia is continuing to take Ukrainian land in grinding battles along the frontline. Overall it's taken about 20 percent of Ukrainian territory. Last year Ukrainian troops took control of part of Russia's Kursk region, but have only held onto a sliver of that territory. \nThere are no independently verified casualties figures, but Russia is estimated to have lost somewhere between 200,000 and 250,000 troops. In February, President Zelenskyy said Ukraine had lost 46,000 troops. In addition, some 13,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed in Russia's full-scale invasion. \nSince Ukraine is outmanned and outgunned by Russia's much larger army, it has concentrated on developing high-tech weapons.

        "title": "Ukrainian drones launch large-scale hunt for Russians attacking on motorcycles, casualties mount",
        "description": "#Kanal13​ #likekanal13​ #subscribekanal13 #warinukraine\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1 - SUBSCRIBE TO US!\nWith its armored vehicles running low and Ukrainian drones dominating the skies, the Russian army is being forced to resort to using motorcycles in assault operations. It's a desperate move that could turn into a sensible strategy, Business Insider reports .\n\nThe author of the publication admits that motorcycles were used in all the great wars of the machine era, but as a means of transportation in the rear and in the frontline zone. The Russians are probably the first to replace tanks and infantry fighting vehicles with motorcycles in combat.\n\n\"Russia's increased use of motorcycles is an adaptation in response to widespread Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian armor and the disproportionate armor losses that Russian forces suffered in late 2023 and 2024,\" according to a new report from the U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War.\n\nIt should be acknowledged that the motorcycle has its obvious strengths - it is a fairly fast and maneuverable vehicle that can overcome a dangerous zone in a short time, avoiding drone strikes. And that is why the Russians seem to be betting on motorcycle assault squads now. At the same time, the use of motorcycles occurs to a certain extent consciously.\n\n\"Russian motorcyclists are now attacking in columns of eight motorcycles with the support of electronic warfare (EW) systems. Russian servicemen are carrying EW systems in the front, center and at the end of the columns to protect the motorcycles from attacks by Ukrainian drones,\" said a Ukrainian soldier who is fighting in the Pokrovsk direction.\n\nRussia uses motorcyclists in two scenarios - either as a \"hit and run\" method or as a way to quickly break through a fortified defense.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War notes that the use of motorcycles was not an idea of the Russian high command, but a desperate improvisation on the front lines in the face of high losses from Ukrainian drones. The use of drones in the Russian army began in the same way.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry is currently trying to formally organize frontline operations using motorcycles. In particular, it is proposed to create motorcycle training centers, as well as integrate motorcycle units into regular military formations. This means that the motorcycle assault concept can be extended to all Russian brigades in Ukraine and, possibly, become part of Russian tactics in future wars.\n\nHowever, the centralized motorization of the Russian army also carries certain risks, analysts say. In particular, it may reduce the ability of the Russian army to adapt to the new realities of the front, analysts note.\n\nMotorcycles have begun to be used for this, and in large numbers. Dozens of motorcyclists can be involved in one attack . In most cases, such attacks end in nothing but huge losses.\n\nhttp://youtube.com/kanal13az/join - click here and support Kanal13 monthly for distributing more videos and independent journalism\n\nhttp://t.me/kanal13tv & https://bit.ly/37BVMqU \nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1\nhttps://bit.ly/2Rs6MB3 \n#lastminutenewsfromukraine #kanal13ukraine  \nhttps://bit.ly/2V19Fdy\n\nClick here and just subscribe to Kanal13 - https://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/KANAL13AZ/join\n*ATTENTION: If you woul like to contact with US please, write to +49176 75077516 WhatsApp\n\n▌▌►Website: http://kanal13.tv/\nhttp://www.facebook.com/tvkanal13\nhttps://twitter.com/Kanal13Az\nhttps://www.instagram.com/kanal13.az\n\nClick & Subscribe to the main youtube Channel\n\n© KANAL13 [ Azərbaycanın ilk peşəkar internet televiziyası ] The First Internet TV of Azerbaijan\n\nTags: #Ukriane, #Russia, #Putin, #Putler, #Russian invasion of Ukraine, #Zelenski, #Kiev, #Kyiv, #Kadirov army, #Kadirov, #Kherson, #Bucha, #Kharkiv, #Ukrainian pilots, #vagners, #Russian tanks, #NATO, #drones, #Moscow, #Kreml, #war victims #Ukraina, News, The Washington Post, waPo Video, Washington Post Video, Washington Post YouTube, a:politics, aid, biden, putin, s:Politics, support, t:Other, Ukraine, war, fact check, news coverage, Donald Trump, news, wp video, forbes, nytimes, newspaper, media, journalism, Ilham Aliyev, Baku, Azerbaijan, Israel, Gaza, Palestine, Tel-Aviv, Garabag, Karabakh, football, ronaldo, messi, brian tyler cohen",
