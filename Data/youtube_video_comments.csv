Russia has had thousands of volunteers join the professional force and they are well trained. It is Ukraine that sends raw troops to the front. Ammunition is low and drones don’t close that gap. Pokrovsk and other places are being surrounded and will collapse. After these last few towns it’s an open field run to the Dnieper. Ukraine cannot defend that open country. Russian troops are already across the Dnieper at Kherson. Michael is really on a propaganda talk, trotting out delusional nonsense.

About "" paying the price""  of your actions: 
Russian arms exports in 2023 had fallen 84%, from 8,300 to 1,300 TVI, compared to 2013, the year before the Russian invasion of Crimea and Donbas. In 2012 Russia accounted for about 30% of the world's export value and in 2023 only 4.4%. 
Russia had 31 nations as clients in 2013. In 2023, post-Ukraine invasion, only 3 countries placed orders for new Russian weapons:  Iran, China and Kyrgyzstan. Moreover, a large part of those are not new orders from 2022-2023, but old orders that have been on the table for many years, well before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Fundamentally, Russia now relies on a single buyer, Teheran, which is under heavy international sanctions and facing double-digit inflation.
Why so?  ""The war in Ukraine undermined the reputation of many Russian weapon systems, often demonstrating their ineffectiveness or obsolescence.”
Russia cannot sell oil, cannot sell gas, cannot sell weapons. Moreover, Poop-in is spending hundreds of billions of dollars of Russian people’s money to destroy another country, but not to repair and build Russia. Russia has no future, and a sad, misereable present.

 “Russian History before Peter the Great is one memorial service, and after Peter the Great, one criminal case.”
Fyodor Ivanovich Tyutchev, 1803-1873. RUSSIAN poet and diplomat.

2JsmSs3oPjc,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"Russia is negotiating from the position of strength due to its obvious successes on the battlefield. Ukraine, in the meantime, desperately needs a ceasefire because it is losing and needs a pause to recover and regroup.

Russia holds all the cards, and Ukraine badly needs a respite.

Russian forces reportedly launched 112 strike drones, primarily of the “Geran” type, targeting Ukrainian infrastructure, including in Kyiv and Odesa. Ukrainian defenses struggled to repel the onslaught, losing another F-16 fighter jet in the process. The pilot ejected safely, but the incident highlights the growing strain on Ukraine’s air capabilities.

On the frontlines, Ukrainian forces renewed attempts to breach Russian defenses in the Kursk region, deploying infantry, mobile units, and even boats to cross the Seym River. Russian troops repelled multiple incursions, destroying armored vehicles and thwarting sabotage groups disguised in Russian uniforms. However, Ukrainian rocket attacks inflicted damage on civilian infrastructure, including a hospital and a church in Tetkino, further escalating tensions.

The Russian offensive continued on Donbass frontlines, with the liberation of Volnoye Pole in the south and sustained pressure on key strongholds like Konstantinovka in the north. Russian victory in Torske near Krasny Liman further weakened Ukrainian positions, with reports indicating severe manpower shortages in defending Ukrainian units.  Russian forces, meanwhile, consolidated gains near Pokrovsk, threatening to envelop Ukrainian defenses along the Kazenny Torets River. Western analysts noted a cascading collapse of Ukrainian defenses in several directions, attributing Russian gains to relentless airstrikes and artillery barrages.

The juxtaposition of ongoing negotiations and escalating combat operations underscores the precarious nature of the conflict. While diplomats are trying to engage in dialogue, the battlefield realities suggest neither side is willing to cede ground without a fight. The coming days will reveal whether the talks in Istanbul can yield tangible de-escalation or if the war will continue to overshadow diplomatic efforts.

I believe that as the Russians continue to put pressure on Ukrainian lines (and Europe failing to help) Ukraines line will collapse by this Fall. 
Ukraine will loose at least half of it's territory.. the defensive line will only be stabilized if Poland or the Germans step in. 

If Germany and/or Poland fail mobilize and help, it'll be the Baltics next. The US will be unable to help NATO because the strike into the Baltics will be coordinated with a Chinese adventure in Taiwan.

For four years Germany was entrenched in France, never budging. They lost. The complete fools in the comment section would have been claiming German victory.

Man power, industrial power, and morale wins wars. Russia have less man power, less economic power, and less morale than they did two years ago. In that time, Ukraine has become the world's military drone super power, producing more military drones than any other country, even the USA and China. Ukraine have also developed their own cruise missile capable of hitting as far into Russia as Moscow. What has Russia developed in that time? Nothing. Russia is fighting with the same military tech it started the war with. It started as a military super power vs a plucky underdog. It is now a military super power vs another military super power. Make no mistake, that's what Ukraine is currently.

If the European economy continues to back Ukraine, and there is no sign of it stopping, Russia has absolutely zero chance of winning this war. The only thing that could change that would be the USA or China joining Russia. Europe's economy dwarfs Russia's. People love to point out that Europe buys gas of Russia still. Russia's gas exports have dropped significantly every year since the war began.",@awesimo4684,2025-05-16T22:32:31Z,0.0

2JsmSs3oPjc,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"Michael Clarke is correct.  The Russian diplomatic position [ Istanbul protocol ]  is rejection of Ukraine sovereignty, and Russia is failing badly against the Ukraine Army in Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine.
Ukraine is getting fighter planes and massive amounts of artillery rounds from the Europeans this year. 
Clarke also correctly states that the Russian soldiers are basically untrained and mostly ineffective.  They are suffering hideous losses, more than three times the losses of Ukraine forces.
Ukraine repeatedly makes deep and crippling strikes within Russia, which Russia never expected and still cannot hold off.
Russia cannot produce sufficient tanks or jet planes for this war.  The Ukraine Army neutralized more than five thousand Russian tanks, and large numbers of their tank crews.
Russia also keeps losing many air defense systems, and these are extremely hard to replace.
Today Russia uses donkeys for Ukraine battlefront logistics, like in the First World War era.
The Russian economy - now in large part a war economy -  is in very bad shape and the Russian war against Ukraine is beginning to fail.
Both sides are suffering hideous losses but Ukraine will still be standing in five years, so what about the future of Russia?
I expect the Russian Federation to fall down and break apart within five years, mainly due to economic collapse and regional nationalist movements.
In short, Ukraine loses a great deal but Russia loses everything.",@wcangel,2025-05-16T16:56:10Z,1.0

I would chose now. Then Trump will go for Greenland, Denmark will ask Russia for help (cos NATO is weak), Europe can reform NATO as an in house alliance with Russia as the ship’s anchor … avoiding nuclear war. . . it’s not looking likely that European leaders can see this light now, but could someone please tell Ukraine they’ve lost ?

In 2025, Putin forces Zelenesky to beg him to stop the war.
In early 2022, in Istanbul, Ukraine refused to accept peace with Russia because the West wanted an indirect war with Russia.
Today, the West and Ukraine are desperate to end the war.

lNOpwpzpvCk,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"As soon as this war ends, Putin has zero domestic political capital left. When this war ends, it could even trigger the collapse of the Russian Federation. The stratospheric irony: when Putin launched the invasion he claimed it was about Russia's survival (against the ""Nazi regime"" in Kyiv--only a Kremlin propagandist could utter a howler like that with a straight, KGB poker face). 

Of COURSE Putin, the soullness KGB chief, capitalized on romantic Great Patriotic War rhetoric to canonize his aggression as a sacred Crusade for Holy Mother Russia. And of COURSE it was all a lie. Bees buzz, pigs oink, and Putin lies. 

And the stratospheric irony? Russia's survival wasn't under ANY threat before Putin deranged stunt. But NOW, it really IS about Russia's survival, and only because PUTIN has dragged Russia down to these desperate depths. 

NOW, because of Putin, NATO is larger, Russia is a political-economic pariah, millions of Russian men are either dead, maimed, missing or have fled from Russia to escape the draft, the West is abandoning Russian energy, and you can be sure that China is licking its chops just waiting to retake eastern territories once part of the kingdom. 

It's about Russia's survival NOW, and... who CARES!  It's about PUTIN'S survival, but... who CARES! It's Putin's fault, it's the fault of a country that tolerated him so long--they've made their bed and will have to lie in it.  Doesn't alter reality one bit: Putin has to be defeated, period.

lNOpwpzpvCk,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"Channel 4 you seems to not be able to understand that the international court still have a warrant for president putin, president zelensky knew that putin cannot show if turkey cannot guarantee putin's visit without arrest, therefore it quietly passes underneath the table.
Also ukraine still to day present have a decree issued by zelensky himself where ukraine banning all the direct negotiations with russia, untl russia leave don. regions from all military presence. EU is very aware that if putin enters in many UN nations or EU he will be arrested.
So we may all hate putin but at least EU should represent the news correctly and not miss crucial facts for why one doesn't appear on the table. Be a news outlet, not a speculation channel.

Thats like your ex wife standing outside your home calling the police while you both have restraining orders and beckoning you to come outside and approach her to violate yours first. XD News: this man is not serious about negotiating with his ex cuz he did not showed up. Really, thats your take?

Better news: Russia again didn't showed up for peace negotiation despite the international pressure for peace talks while IC refuses to take down the warrant issued for putin which complicates things for direct talks, unless both sides meet on neutral ground, but considering how many countries are involved in the conflict finding neutral ground for peace negotiations might prove difficult as neither side would sit on the table without security guarantees. And all of that while military actions continue on the territory of ukraine and thousands of ukranians are in fear of their life and still threatened to leave their homes, be evacuated, relocated or flee of fear for their life.",@RongYaoElk,2025-05-15T21:30:56Z,0.0

Please, evacuate to Zion, the Church of God, before disaster comes.

You must listen to God's words and warnings.
If you keep the Passover, God will save you from any disasters.
You have to believe this.

The Spirit and the bride say, ""Come!"" And let him who hears say, ""Come!"" Whoever is thirsty, let him come, and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life.(Revelation 22:17)

Father Spirit and Mother bride have called you to come back to Zion, and come back to God's precepts, rules, and laws.

In the midst of frequent wars, various natural disasters, unpredictabile and sudden accidents, when you celebrate the P.A.S.S.O.V.E.R, the flesh and blood of Christ, Heavenly Father and Mother protect you from any disasters and prevent you from danger. Furthermore if you keep the Passover, you can live your daily life comfortably, hoping for an eternal kingdom of heaven without fear of disaster.
Have faith in Elohim God to protect you, and you can be protected from any danger if you come to Zion in the event of such a disaster.
If you always live a life worthy of going to heaven with a correct and pious life and a beautiful heart, our father, Ahn Sang-hong, and 
our heavenly mother will take care of you safely.

Listen to God's words in the church of true truth, the church of God, and the nearby Zion, which is done according to the Bible, and let's all meet in heaven without sadness or pain.

Putin NEVER stated in his statement that he would be going in fact he categorically stated he would send  delegate to meet up with Ukrainian  delegates. He sent very much the same team as in 2022 back then nobody said Russia was not serious due to the team composition. Moreover negotiations are conducted this way before the principals meet to enact and sign the final face. Zelensky has acted like a brat nit a statement. He is such a fool who is being led by other fools  who should know better but their pathological hatred of Russia prevent them from thinking properly or analytically. Russia is winning the special military operation and will dictates the terms. If in 2022 Russia had declared WAR and not an SMO it would have taken them less than 4 weeks to utterly break Ukraine , think about that!",@meneliktaseti,2025-05-15T19:04:46Z,0.0

lNOpwpzpvCk,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"UKRAINE PEACE TALKS  2025 ??
Wars are waged by older men
In battle rooms in countries apart.
Who call for greater firepower
And troops for the combat chart.

While out among the shattered flesh
The dreams of all have turned gray.
So young and determined their faces were
Till on the battlefield they lay.

Unable to overcome their pride
The politicians cast their vote.
For this or that or something else
As the rage of war sounds its note.

Death to death, dust to dust
The wrath of war is a horrible crime.
It’s the beast within that still prevails
As it has through the torments of time.

Some question why study history
Does our future depend on the past?
When we forget history, we repeat its mistakes
As the outcomes of all are cast.

Does any remember that Zelenski actually passed a law forbidding any Ukrainian to negotiate with Russia after the peace agreement was signed in Constantinoupoli/ Istanbul , and the Ukrainian negotiator that signed the deal was later killed under mysterious circumstances.
Does anyone remember Zelenski sayi g that the MINSK agreements were dead about 2 weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine. 
Does anyone remember Zelenski saying that he was thinking of acquiring a nuclear bomb to defend Ukraine against the Russians 1 week before the Russians invaded. 
Does anyone remember the overthrow of the legitimate government of Ukraine in 2014 that was supported by the Democrats/ Neocons of the USA. Does anyone remember that the Neo NAZIS  that took the power in 2014 started attacking the Russian speaki population in east Ukraine. 

Does anyone remember that Russia swiftly reacted an annexed Crimea the population of which is 80% ethnic Russian. 
Does anyone remember the promise that Gorbachev was given by the USA that NATO wont expand towards Russian. 
Does anyone remember when Putin asked Bill Clinton if Russia could join NATO since NATO was expanding eastwards. 
Does anyone remember that Clinton replied that Russia can not join the defencive alliance NATO.

FhSgx_IoQ-Y,Satellite images show Putin massing Russian troops on border with Finland,"Satellite images show Putin building up a substantial military presence on the Finnish border.

Images obtained by Swedish broadcaster SVT show four locations have seen a significant increase in activity.

NATO member Finland heavily protects its eastern border.

In 2022, a border fence was erected to provide more defence against a Russian invasion.

Following Finland’s accession to NATO, Kremlin officials threatened ‘military-technical response measures’.

This move shows a worrying war stance being adopted by Putin on Russia’s north-east border.

FhSgx_IoQ-Y,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"Finland joined NATO in 2023, which showed that it is no longer a neutral country. Therefore, all these developments should not be surprising. Joining any military alliance comes with its advantages and disadvantages. One disadvantage is that you may end up with soldiers who have three years of combat experience stationed at your border, while an advantage is that NATO will respond — maybe. But Russia will not attack Finland, at least that’s what I believe. I just think that Russia wants to strengthen its borders with NATO in case of any crisis, and by reinforcing the border, Russia aims to deter NATO from doing anything. Nothing will happen, don’t worry.",@KING-pc2tp,2025-05-19T18:47:19Z,1.0

Putin is attacking weaker countries with less able denfses in land grabbing resources control. Putin actions are much like a previous lunatics ambition to rule the world. Efforts of appeasement only placated the attempted peace efforts which ultimately failed and led to continued aggression and all out war. I see much of the same events and tatics being employed yet again with even more destruction and devastation following than the previous events. This will not end until Putin is forced to capitulate and the same for China who is waiting and watching to make their move. I pray I'm wrong, but I think not",@daviddill921,2025-05-19T01:06:56Z,0.0

Heck, the Swedish fighter jet the Gripen is designed with a conflict against Russia in mind.

This is either pure bluff, or a feint with the real targets being the baltic states.  The troops on the border of Finland are also very near the border with Estonia.  Putin is also massing troops for an ""exercise"" in Belarus that borders both Lithuania and Latvia.

Not because they were superior, but since they had experience vs. the whermacht. Today, it's that russia has experience in moder day combat. Drones, artillery, and other devastating weaponry.
Finland has much less artillery, drones, and men. Today, it would be different if russia would invade in the summer. Not excessive snowfall and 10x more drones and artillery. Unless its in the winter, then idk who'd win, but Russia is not dumb enough to go to war with NATO (most probably without the USA as they are normalizing relations with russia and toppling relations with Ukraine and the EU, especially by calling the EU an anti-american organization).",@HistoryStuff-i8o,2025-05-13T12:41:14Z,1.0

As of 2024, Russia occupies almost 20% of Ukraine and about 3 to 3.5 million Ukrainians are estimated to be living under occupation; since the invasion, the occupied territories lost roughly half of their population

Gen. Mark Milley  say ukriane lost two hundred thousand soldiers 200000
publish data on Ukrainian losses during the current conflict on January 14, 2023:

   1,157,000 dead
    234,000 injured
    27,230 in captivity,
    934 dead NATO instructors (USA and Great Britain),
    32,458 dead NATO servicemen (Germany, Poland, Lithuania, etc.)
    15,360 dead mercenaries.
but now in 2025 its more like 800000

Russia 
describes military doctrine as defensive military doctrine. With regard 
to nuclear weapons specifically, Russia reserves the right to use 
nuclear weapons: in response to the use of nuclear and other types of 
weapons of mass destruction against it or its allies,in case of 
aggression against Russia with the use of conventional weapons when the 
very existence of the state is threatened
How do Russian nuclear weapons compare to the rest of the world?

How do Russian nuclear weapons compare to the rest of the world?

Yeah, Russia is renovating their old buildings in the bases and the roads. Not surprising at all and not alarming.
After the full invasion started, it was estimated that they had only 20% amount of troops and equipment in the bases. It is estimated that it will take about 3-5 years for Russia to get those bases back to full strenght.
Also Russia has based bombers close to Finland and do you know why? Not to plan attack Finland but because they are mostly safe there. It is dificult for Ukraine to attack those air bases this far. They run regularly sorties from those bases to Ukraine.",@Valokaari,2025-05-13T08:44:59Z,0.0

FhSgx_IoQ-Y,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"This is just troop rotation and buildup after Finland dropped its Neutrality posture and joined NATO. This deployment was outlined last year to react to new NATO bases near the Russian Border. The British tabloids' overreaction is really shocking.

Nobody is going to attack Finland, as the Border Dispute was resolved between 1939 and 1945, with Finland losing Lake Ladoga, the Karelia Peninsular, the City of Vyborg, Petsamo, and Sala, and access to the Arctic Ocean.

This was outlined in the Treaty of Moscow in 1945.

So the British Media, as usual, is always trying to stir up rhetoric, like Putin will attack NATO; the British think they need to ramp up Missile Defense as the Russians are planning to attack.

Yes, the Russian Warships were just sailing by and waving hello when they traversed the French Channel on their way to their Mediterranean deployment.

It's armed forces are very good and the Terrain is perfect for defence with a lot of the country woods, this army is well prepared with over 100,000.00 reservist as well.

FhSgx_IoQ-Y,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"His first mistake was to attack Ukraine when Biden was in office.  Because Biden has a long history of Global Positioning he was able to unite a coalition of nations against Russia with sanctions and unite a coalition of nations to help Ukraine.  Trump was ready to pull us out of NATO, his coalition would have been assistance of Putin against Ukraine.  Now that Finland has joined NATO and if Putin decides to attack Finland that would be his second major mistake.  Now that Russias economy and the state of his military has been bashed by Ukraine, he no longer has the capability of attacking a NATO member.",@michaelsaldivar4901,2025-05-12T19:40:36Z,0.0

But he still doesn't believe it and is still making propaganda videos for authoritarianism, claiming that Russia's GDP is rising while the world's GDP is in a stage of decline. It is ridiculous that the GDP of a country that starts a war will increase.",@Holami-yes,2025-05-19T16:59:23Z,0.0

""A good chess player thinks several moves ahead. What he doesn't do is predict these moves to his opponent,"" Makeiev told the German Press Agency. ""As ambassador of Ukraine, I am privy to such secrets,"" he added. After Chancellor Friedrich Merz's visit to Kyiv, he was therefore able to confirm: ""Germany will deliver. And we know exactly what and when. And we are satisfied."" The former Ukrainian ambassador, Andriy Melnyk, had previously criticized Merz for the return to secrecy. ""This brings back bad memories of the time when the traffic light government tried to conceal a lack of military support in the spring of 2022 with secrecy,"" he said.",@Guenther_Berger,2025-05-12T12:01:56Z,28.0

The Russian Federation does not function in a way that here now you want it, it only functions and broadcasts on ""FANTASTIC"" television from Moscow, but this is a world of visions and delusions. Russian production of military equipment is not impressively large ""AS FOR THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CURRENT WAR, WHAT WE HAVE HERE AND NOW"". The Russian Federation does not function indefinitely. And that something is shown on propaganda television from Moscow, it is only shown, they are happy because they gave them hope, the reality is worse. The television theory and reality, it is really something completely different!!!!!!! The G7 countries provide greater possibilities for now. The BRICS countries are not able to produce the appropriate amount of military equipment for a specific time, on top of that they are technologically backward. Therefore, in any number of years the Russian Federation will definitely not win this war. There will be more and more war mercenaries. You Russians are dying unnecessarily. But this is already a certain, wrong ideological idea. Here, certain hunter schemes should come out in order to save a larger number of people. But this will not work in old or new Russia, so they die unnecessarily, gaining nothing for themselves, except only losses. As for the acquisition of a small area of ​​Ukrainian land in 3 years, where the number of dead Russian soldiers is slowly approaching 740,000. Your comrade Joseph Stalin made a record, he caused the deaths of 24,000,000 Russians in various circumstances. The Ukrainian land acquired for the Russian Federation will be almost imperceptible in comparison to the vastness of the largest country in the world, so one should think before the war (???).

https://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1 - SUBSCRIBE TO US!
The aggressor country is urgently changing its plans regarding propaganda events timed to coincide with May 9. Following the massive attack by Ukrainian drones on Russian territory, a wave of cancellations of events planned for the said date has begun in the Russian Federation,  Verstka  writes . The restrictions affected at least Moscow, the Moscow region, the Vladimir, Lipetsk, Vologda regions and Mordovia. Thus, in Yegoryevsk, the memorial service for the victims was moved from the cemetery to the church ""for safety reasons."" In Ramenskoye, a school performance was cancelled, and in the Pavlovsky Posad District, evening concerts were cancelled, while car rallies and flower-laying ceremonies were retained. In the Vladimir region, the Immortal Regiment march and an evening concert have been cancelled in Kirzhach due to the ""threat of a UAV crash"". Similar measures have been taken in the Lipetsk region, where events have been postponed indefinitely and some events have been transferred to an online format. In Mordovia, the gala concert has been postponed to May 15 – officially due to ""Internet restrictions."" In the Vologda Region, bad weather was cited as the reason for postponing the events. In addition, performances by Russian artists who were unable to fly out of the Russian capital due to flight delays are being cancelled. 

Recall, Russia’s Defense Ministry has claimed its air defenses destroyed about 524 Ukrainian drones in a single day during what it called the most massive drone attack to date. The figure came after pro-war Russian military bloggers reported a record drone and missile assault on Russia overnight into May 7. The Z-affiliated Telegram channel Voevoda Veshchaet stated that 447 long-range drones and missiles had struck Russia between the evening of May 6 and early hours of May 7. The bloggers described it as the largest drone attack since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. During the night, Russian Telegram channels tracked swarms of drones headed toward Moscow via Ryazan, Tula and Oryol oblasts. Residents in the Moscow suburbs of Yegoryevsk and Kolomna reported hearing the sound of UAVs and explosions.

By morning, Russian airlines had begun mass cancellations and flight mergers, citing disruptions caused by the drone attacks.

Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine’s Center for Counteracting Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council, said a number of high-value targets within Russia’s military-industrial complex had been hit.

In Saransk, a fiber-optic systems plant was struck. In Tula, the attack targeted the Instrument Design Bureau. Another target was the Splav enterprise, a key developer of multiple launch rocket systems for the Russian military.

The aggressor country is urgently changing its plans regarding propaganda events timed to coincide with May 9. Following the massive attack by Ukrainian drones on Russian territory, a wave of cancellations of events planned for the said date has begun in the Russian Federation,  Verstka  writes . The restrictions affected at least Moscow, the Moscow region, the Vladimir, Lipetsk, Vologda regions and Mordovia. Thus, in Yegoryevsk, the memorial service for the victims was moved from the cemetery to the church ""for safety reasons."" In Ramenskoye, a school performance was cancelled, and in the Pavlovsky Posad District, evening concerts were cancelled, while car rallies and flower-laying ceremonies were retained. In the Vladimir region, the Immortal Regiment march and an evening concert have been cancelled in Kirzhach due to the ""threat of a UAV crash"". Similar measures have been taken in the Lipetsk region, where events have been postponed indefinitely and some events have been transferred to an online format. In Mordovia, the gala concert has been postponed to May 15 – officially due to ""Internet restrictions."" In the Vologda Region, bad weather was cited as the reason for postponing the events. In addition, performances by Russian artists who were unable to fly out of the Russian capital due to flight delays are being cancelled. 

Recall, Russia’s Defense Ministry has claimed its air defenses destroyed about 524 Ukrainian drones in a single day during what it called the most massive drone attack to date. The figure came after pro-war Russian military bloggers reported a record drone and missile assault on Russia overnight into May 7. The Z-affiliated Telegram channel Voevoda Veshchaet stated that 447 long-range drones and missiles had struck Russia between the evening of May 6 and early hours of May 7. The bloggers described it as the largest drone attack since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. During the night, Russian Telegram channels tracked swarms of drones headed toward Moscow via Ryazan, Tula and Oryol oblasts. Residents in the Moscow suburbs of Yegoryevsk and Kolomna reported hearing the sound of UAVs and explosions.

By morning, Russian airlines had begun mass cancellations and flight mergers, citing disruptions caused by the drone attacks.

Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine’s Center for Counteracting Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council, said a number of high-value targets within Russia’s military-industrial complex had been hit.

In Saransk, a fiber-optic systems plant was struck. In Tula, the attack targeted the Instrument Design Bureau. Another target was the Splav enterprise, a key developer of multiple launch rocket systems for the Russian military.

We are worse than all other creatures on earth because they don't destroy the planet but we do. I believe that there are in the Universe a lot of habitable planets but we are the worst one.

To give it away—like a death too small.
Dying for love, yet we stand tall.
In every breath, we leave a piece,
On every inch, our hearts find peace.

Ukraine screams, sings, and cries pure tears.
A war from beyond has fed our fears.
The so-called brotherhood, poisoned above,
Brought fratricide to the land we love.

While Russia roars with death and hate,
And crocodile tears come far too late,
Its people move like hollow ghosts—
They look, but they don't see.
They listen, yet hear nothing.
They speak, but their words are lost.

WEVwY3XkTrI,North Korea confirms it sent troops to fight for Russia in Ukraine war | BBC News,"North Korea has for the first time confirmed that it sent troops to fight for Russia against Ukraine.
 
In a report on state news agency KCNA, Pyongyang's military claimed its soldiers helped Russian forces ""completely liberate"" the Kursk border region, according to an order given by leader Kim Jong Un.
 
Pyongyang's announcement comes just days after Russian Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov praised the ""heroism"" of North Korean troops, the first time Moscow has publicly acknowledged their involvement.
 
Western officials had earlier told the BBC they believed at least 1,000 of the 11,000 troops sent from North Korea had been killed over three months.

WEVwY3XkTrI,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"A Plan for the USA and England to Stand Up to Global Threats

Here’s a detailed, down-to-earth plan for how the USA and England (as part of the UK) can team up to tackle big global adversaries like Russia, China, and North Korea. This isn’t just about power—it’s about protecting people, supporting Ukraine, and making the world a safer place. We’ll cover military moves, economic punches, and diplomatic teamwork, all while keeping it human and real.



Military Strategies: Showing Strength, Protecting Lives

The USA and England have a long history of standing together when the going gets tough. Here’s how they can flex their military might—not to start fights, but to stop them before they spiral out of control:





Backing Eastern Europe
Picture families in places like Poland or Latvia, worried about Russia stirring trouble nearby. The USA and England can send more troops and top-notch missile defenses to Eastern Europe, working hand-in-hand with NATO. Joint training with local forces would be like a loud message to Russia: “We’re here, we’re united, and we’re not messing around.”



Arming Ukraine with What They Need
Ukraine’s people are fighting for their homes—think of the courage it takes to stand up to a giant like Russia. The USA and England can supply them with advanced weapons, like long-range missiles, to push back Russian forces. Sharing real-time intelligence would be like giving Ukraine a map to navigate the chaos, helping them protect their kids and communities.



Getting Ukraine into NATO, Fast
Ukraine wants in on NATO, and why wouldn’t they? It’s like joining a big family that’s got your back. The USA and England can lead the charge to speed this up, making it clear that if Russia attacks a NATO member, they’re taking on the whole team. That’s a line in the sand Putin won’t want to cross.



Keeping China in Line in the Indo-Pacific
China’s been eyeing places like Taiwan, acting like they own the neighborhood. The USA and England can boost naval patrols and air support in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait, teaming up with allies like Japan and Australia. It’s like keeping an eye on the street to make sure no one gets out of hand—stronger together.



Stopping North Korea’s Bluster
North Korea keeps lobbing missiles like it’s a game. The USA and England can work with South Korea and Japan, setting up better missile defenses—like catching those missiles before they cause harm. Quiet cyber moves could also mess with North Korea’s plans, like flipping off their lights when they least expect it.



Economic Strategies: Hitting the Wallet Hard

Money keeps these adversaries going, so the USA and England can use their economic clout to turn the tables. Here’s how:





Cutting Russia’s Cash Flow
Russia’s war depends on selling oil and gas. The USA and England can tighten sanctions to choke that off, making it harder for Putin to fund his aggression. They can also lean on countries like India or China, saying, “You’re either with us or with him—choose wisely.” Kicking Russia out of global finance is like taking away their credit card.



Breaking Europe’s Reliance on Russian Gas
Imagine European families stuck in the cold because Russia controls their energy. The USA can ship more natural gas to Europe, while England pushes for wind and solar projects. It’s like helping a friend grow their own food instead of begging from the enemy.



Putting the Squeeze on China
China’s been bending trade rules for years. The USA and England can hit them with tariffs and block their access to Western tech—like telling them, “Play fair or sit out.” Moving factories to friendly countries would create jobs elsewhere and loosen China’s hold.



Keeping North Korea Broke
North Korea dodges sanctions like it’s a sport. The USA and England can team up with allies to close those loopholes, especially with China, cutting off Kim’s cash for weapons. No money, no missiles—it’s that simple.



Diplomatic Strategies: Teaming Up to Win

Sometimes talking—or not talking—can be just as powerful as fighting. Here’s how the USA and England can lead with smarts:





Boxing Out Russia and China
Think of Russia and China as the troublemakers everyone’s tired of. The USA and England can pull together NATO, the EU, and allies like Japan and India to freeze them out. Sweetening the deal with trade or aid for countries like Brazil could peel them away from the bad guys—it’s like building a club no one wants to miss.



Cheering Ukraine On, Worldwide
Ukraine’s fight is everyone’s fight. The USA and England can rally the world to send more weapons, cash, and rebuilding help—think of it as a global fundraiser for freedom. Pushing Europe to ditch Russian gas for good would keep the momentum going.



Handling North Korea Carefully
North Korea’s tricky, like a wild card. The USA and England can keep quiet talks going, nudging Kim to drop his nukes, while piling on pressure with South Korea and Japan. It’s a carrot-and-stick approach—firm but open to change.



Leading the World as a Team
Picture Trump—or any leader—calling the shots like a coach, getting everyone on the same page. The USA and England can spearhead this, showing the world how to stand tall. It’s not just about being tough—it’s about inspiring others to join in.



Ukraine and the World: One Big Fight





Ukraine’s Role
Ukraine’s the little engine that could, battling for their land and their lives. With the USA and England’s help—weapons, intel, NATO—they can keep going. Every day they resist, they prove freedom’s worth fighting for.



The World’s Part
This isn’t just Ukraine’s war—it’s a wake-up call. The USA and England can get Europe, Asia, and beyond to crank up the pressure on Russia, China, and North Korea. Cut their money, stop their weapons, break their support—it’s like the whole world saying, “We’re done with this.”



Wrapping It Up: Tough, Smart, and Human

The USA and England have the muscle, the brains, and the heart to pull this off. It’s not about starting wars—it’s about stopping them by arming Ukraine, hitting Russia and China where it hurts, and leading a world that’s had enough of bullies. This is for the Ukrainian mom who just wants her kids safe, the European worker who needs heat in winter, the Asian kid who deserves a peaceful tomorrow. Together, they can make it happen—and show the world what strength really looks like.",@inmortalmilamores,2025-04-29T22:10:32Z,1.0

India is rising but have problems with looking after their population, and you can only become a powerhouse if your people are looked after and doing well, China should have taken over as the powerhouse but they are peaking and their people are creating a huge divide between poor and rich which create the decline in a nation  and destroys the powerhouse look at the UK and American history etc…Europe can do It but needs to work better in Brussel and form solid alliance with countries like Canada, Australia, Mexico…the future is near, who will be the next Powerhouse!?",@brianpovlsen7767,2025-04-29T19:27:33Z,0.0

1. We are ALL sinners - (Rom. 6:23) For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;









*Sin separates us from the Holy God









2. There is a punishment for our sin -(Rom. 6:23a) For the wages of sin is death;








* Death - eternal death - HELL









3. God loves us, He does not want us to go to Hell, He provided a way for our escape from Hell - (Rom. 5:8) But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.









* Because of God's love for us, He sent his only son Jesus Christ to die in our place on the cross. Jesus Christ took all the weight of our sins so we can be saved through grace, NOT our works.









* The blood that Jesus shed on the cross can wash away our sins and make us clean









4. Through Jesus Christ, we can now have eternal life in HEAVEN - (Rom. 6:23b) but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.









*Gift - free, but you can only have it if you receive it. If you reject it then the punishment of Hell is waiting for you









5. How can I receive eternal life? - (Rom. 10:9) That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 









* You have to admit you are a sinner and you cannot save yourself from Hell nor go to Heaven through your own efforts.








 You have to believe in your heart that Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins, was buried and rose again after 3 days and that He and only He can save you from hell.









(Roman 10:13) For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  









* Whosoever means anyone including me and you! 









Do you want to do it? Pray this prayer:









Dear God, I admit I am a sinner and cannot save myself from hell. I believe that Jesus Christ died for my sins, was buried and rose again. I believe that only  Jesus Christ can save me from Hell and He is the only way to Heaven.  I accept Jesus Christ in my heart as my Lord and Savior. Thank You for eternal life. Amen.

The objective for the West is not a quick war, it is a perpetual war so that the tax payers money is siphoned off to the private military industrial complex. Russia tried for many years to engage in diplomatic agreements (see Minsk agreements) to stop Ukrainian expansion into the Donbas, effectively allowing western military bases to be within nuclear range of Moscow. Imagine what the US would do if Russia had military bases in Mexico, for instance. This war was the last resort option for Putin to stop the continuous agressive expansion of NATO into Russian territory. 

People, we are witnessing a global shift in power from West to East. The BRICs nations no longer rely as much on US dollar hegemony. You, the consumer, the working poor and middling classes will suffer, your currency is systematically debased, your freedoms gradually removed, your culture diluted from perverted intentional agendas from the ruling elite.

The number, however, was nowhere close to what was claimed. Many of them were used as drone operators, and a few in direct contact on the front line. This is why Ukraine could not catch them. Anyway, the real message here is that Russia will never go out of troop and can borrow from other countries whenever needed.",@rouz0,2025-04-28T14:58:22Z,1.0

 According to the experts, Ukraine 🇺🇦 lost over 75,000 troops in Kursk. The russan performed the so cslled ""A gaspipiline military operations"" to defit the ukranian. 
The question is, is it worth sacrifying such a huge amount of army in Kursk by zelensky? You know that you will be kicked out???",@gimmy118,2025-04-28T12:11:41Z,0.0

WEVwY3XkTrI,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"Russia and North Korea have an agreement to help each other when their territories are attacked, Kursk was attacked by Ukraine what gave a legal way to allow north korean soldiers to get involved in russian territory.

The US and the NATO on the other hand are sending their soldiers and officers into Ukraine as volunteers, training ukranian soldiers, operating weapons and killing russian soldiers.

Can i have a sincere question?
Are the NATO and the US in war with Russia?

If no, then i think both of them should back off, never should have been involved in this at all because their involvement was the main reason why this conflict escalated into a war.

If yes, then i hope you understand that for every single russian soldier who were killed by NATO and US weapons and soldiers both the NATO countries and the US will have to pay the price in one way or another.

You cannot send billions of dollars for a country to fight against Russia for you then pretend that you are not involved in the war.

You know this basically justifies the russian invasion, because the West is not openly admitting that it is in war with Russia what means that Russia was pretty much right not trusting the word of none of the western leaders.",@LordLemoncake,2025-04-28T11:27:30Z,2.0

On December 5, 1994, leaders of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Russian Federation met in Budapest, Hungary, to pledge security assurances to Ukraine in connection with its accession to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as a non-nuclear-weapons state. The signature of the so-called Budapest Memorandum concluded arduous negotiations that resulted in Ukraine’s agreement to relinquish the world’s third-largest nuclear arsenal, which the country inherited from the collapsed Soviet Union, and transfer all nuclear warheads to Russia for dismantlement. The signatories of the memorandum pledged to respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity and inviolability of its borders, and to refrain from the use or threat of military force. Russia breached these commitments with its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and aggression in eastern Ukraine, bringing the meaning and value of security assurance pledged in the Memorandum under renewed scrutiny.",@trofimlysenko-d6i,2025-04-28T11:18:55Z,0.0

WEVwY3XkTrI,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"Strategic Call for Global Cooperation to Strengthen Ukraine's Autonomous Defense Capabilities
Esteemed Leaders, Innovators, and Partners,

In the face of ongoing global challenges and escalating hybrid threats, it is imperative to act decisively. One of the most impactful ways to support Ukraine today is by massively scaling the production and advancement of unmanned systems — drones, robotics, and AI- and AGI-driven missile technologies — in both volume and diversity of modifications. Machines must engage in warfare, while humans are preserved and protected.

This technological acceleration must primarily be rooted in Ukraine, while international cooperation should be established based on each country's strengths:

The United Kingdom's Rolls-Royce, a global leader in aerospace propulsion, could cooperate with Ukraine’s Yuzhmash, renowned for its rocket and aerospace engineering capabilities, to jointly develop next-generation engines for aerospace and defense.

Japan, a world leader in robotics, can build strategic partnerships with Ukrainian robotics manufacturers, enhancing both nations’ capabilities through collaboration and joint development projects.

Germany, with its premier robotics institutes, could provide research and engineering synergies with Ukraine’s defense technology initiatives.

The United States, leading in Artificial Intelligence, particularly through institutions like DeepMind Robotics, is pioneering AGI — enabling AI systems to understand both natural language and computer vision while controlling robotic manipulators. These advances should be integrated into Ukraine’s defense sector to achieve full autonomy in battlefield robotics.

By connecting Ukraine to such ""technological modules,"" a mutually beneficial exchange of expertise, technology, and real-world testing will be realized, catalyzing innovation on both sides.

Moreover, the development of autonomous, intelligent swarms of drones and robotic systems capable of independent decision-making will drastically change the dynamics of modern defense. AI must be trained to coordinate diverse robotic platforms, enabling seamless and adaptive battlefield cooperation — learning through reinforcement to avoid past mistakes and improve over time.

This is the future that Ukraine, together with its allies, must build:

A fully integrated, autonomous defense ecosystem based on collective strength, innovation, and unwavering strategic vision.

Urgency is critical. China, Russia, and their allies are actively developing similar systems at high speed. This is not merely a technological race — it is a marathon of resilience and supremacy. We are already witnessing a ""new Cold War"" with increasingly ""hot"" elements, impacting the future global balance.

Delays by Ukraine’s allies will only provide China and Russia with greater opportunities to strengthen their positions.
The time to act boldly and cooperatively is now.

Together, through decisive innovation and strategic alliances, we can ensure that the future is protected by the forces of freedom, intelligence, and humanity.",@apocalypse2522,2025-04-28T10:59:55Z,0.0

WEVwY3XkTrI,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"Beware of all religions. “You shall know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” – (The Prophet and Messiah Jesus of Nazareth at John 8: 32) – For God is our true Father. 
So never worship and pray in the way of the many false prophets of all religions,
“But when you pray, go into a room by yourself, and shut the door. Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you. In your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. Do not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him.
This is how you should pray:
Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,
Your kingdom come; your will be done, on earth as in heaven,
Give us today our daily bread,
Forgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.
And do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one.
For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, for ever.
Amen.
For if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.” – (The Prophet and Messiah Jesus of Nazareth at Matthew 6: 6-15) –

“Pass no judgement, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you.” – (at Matthew 7: 1-2) –

“In truth I tell you, if anyone obeys my teaching he shall never know what it is to die.” – (at John 8: 51) –

“Always treat others as you would like them to treat you: that is the Law and the Prophets.
Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it.” – (Matthew 7: 12-14) –

“I am the gate; anyone who comes into the fold through me shall be safe. He shall go in and out and shall find pasturage.
The thief comes only to steal, to kill, to destroy; I have come that men may have life, and may have it in all its fullness.” – (John 10: 9-10) –

“Beware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves.” – (Matthew 7: 15) –

“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.” – (Matthew 7: 21) –
“I am the resurrection and I am life. If a man has faith in me, even though he dies, he shall come to life; and any one who is alive and has faith shall never die.” – (John 11: 25-26) –

“I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world” – (John 12: 47) –
“Whoever then will acknowledge me before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father in heaven; and whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.” – (Matthew 10: 32-34) –

“I am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me. If you knew me you would know my Father too.” – (John 14: 6-7) –

“An expert in the law, [a leading religious Pharisee] tested him with this question: ‘Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?’ He answered, ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind. That is the greatest commandment. It comes first. The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. Everything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.’” – (Matthew 22: 35-40) –

“There is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.” – (John 15: 13) –

“Do not call any man on earth ‘father’ ; for you have one Father and he is in heaven. Nor must you be called ‘teacher’ ; you have one Teacher, the Messiah.” – (Matthew 23: 9-10) –

“Take care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name…” – (Matthew 24: 4) –
“Many false prophets will arise, and will mislead many; and as lawlessness spreads, men’s love for one another will grow cold. But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. ” – (Matthew 24: 11-13) – 

“Teach them to observe all that I have commanded you. And be assured, I am with you always, to the end of time.” – (Matthew 28: 20) –

Yours, in true Spirit and in our one given prayer, 2gointruth, on Monday the28th of April 2025: – (Please read Matthew 5: 14-16) – Where every minute (of both day and night) can be a new beginning for any one of us.

It will be the official end of NATO as well and beginning of the crash of the World Financial Credit System, based on US dollar.  That's why Trump is pressing Ukraine to do it itself and is doing it in a gangster style. Question is what will be left from US after his "" Presidency "", not what will be left from Ukraine.

Was sollte Russland denn tun zusehen wie die vom Westen aufgerüstete und gesteuerte Ukraine militärisch gegen die russischen Menschen im Donbass Donezk uuu vorgeht wie all die Jahre davor schon. Man hat ja in Odessa gesehen was mit unbewaffneten Russen im Haus der Gewerkschaft passiert ist weil sie gegen die Regierung welche mittels Putsch 2014 an die Macht kam in Kiew mithilfe der USA. Wo sind die Prozesse wegen Mordes geblieben!!!???? Oder auf der Krim die russische Bevölkerung die dort seit Katarina der Großen lebt soll am besten freiwillig abhauen oder sie wird deportiert oder anderweitig entfernt wird wie es der Chef des ukrainischen Geheimdienstes erklärt hat sollte die Ukraine wieder über die Krim die Kontrolle haben. Oder gar all die Aktionen von Ultra Rechten privaten militärischen Gruppen wie Asow uuu die nach Feststellung und Aussagen von Amnesty International (welche bestimmt keine Russland-Freunde sind) Kriegsverbrechen begangen haben in der Zeit von 2014-2020 in den östlichen Gebieten der Ukraine die vorwiegend von Russen bewohnt worden. Wo ist die Strafrechts-Verfolgung dieser Taten. Aber nein diese Einheit wird hochgelobt und als Sondereinheit des Innerministerium eingegliedert. Wieso wird ein Mitläufer der Politik der Nazis Herr Banderas plötzlich als Held der Ukraine gesehen. Ist das die Art wie ""der Westen jetzt mit dem Gedankengut der Nationalsozialisten"" umgehen will. Egal ob Frau Merkel oder Herr Hollande beiden Politikern war bekannt ""das in der Ukraine Herr Banderas verherrlicht wird und das bis heute. Wieso wurde und wird nichts gegen diese Verherrlichung von Nationsozialistischen Gedankengut gemacht"". Es war eine politische Farce als im kanadischen Parlament 'ein fruheres ukrainisches Mitglied der Waffen SS ausgezeichnet wurde' von den ehemaligen Verbündeten der UdSSR im Kampf gegen die Nazis. Da kann man bald denken ""Solange es kein Deutscher sagt sondern ein Ausländer wie zB wenn's ein Ukrainer ooo es sagt ist es ja nicht so schlimm oder böse"" und passt ja zu unseren Zielen gegen Russland. ""Genau diese Denkweise gab es schon einmal"" mit verheerenden Folgen für Europa. Auch dort wurde vom bösen Russen gesprochen und man muss aufrüsten und kriegstauglich werden uuu. Alles das was man jetzt in anderen Worten wieder hört. Am Ende gab es Millionen Tote und Opfer und unendliche Zerstörung in Europa.",@torstenscheer3942,2025-05-09T23:47:05Z,0.0

BUT IT MAY BE THAT HISTORY ONLY REMEMBERS HIS HESITATIONS AND LACK OF AMBITION. RUSSIA NOW HAS A HISTORIC CHANCE TO DEFINITELY ESTABLISH ITS INFLUENCE IN EURASIA AND TO ENSURE ITS SECURITY FOR CENTURIES TO COME AGAINST THE WARRIOR INSTINCTS OF THE ANGLOSAXONS. IF PUTIN REFUSES TO INVADE UKRAINE AND DEMAND ITS COMPLETE SURRENDER IN ORDER TO REDESIGN THIS REGION AND ENSURE THE SECURITY AND FUTURE OF RUSSIA, HISTORY WILL NOT FORGIVE HIM THIS MISTAKE.
RUSSIAN VICTORY IN UKRAINE MUST BE TOTAL. UKRAINE MUST BE DISMEMBERED. THE EAST OF THE RIVER DNIEPR AND THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY SHOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. AS FOR THE NORTH-WEST PART, IT MUST BE DEMILITARIZED AND BECOME A NEUTRAL STATE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF RUSSIA. THE REMAINING UKRAINE SHOULD NEVER BE PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION OR NATO. RUSSIA MUST NOT ALLOW ANGLO-AMERICAN CAPITALISM TO RECAPITALIZE ITSELF FROM UKRAINE'S WEALTH. THE ANGLO-AMERICAN PLUNDERING OF OTHER NATIONS THAT HAS BEEN THE BASIS OF THEIR CAPITALIST SYSTEM FOR 500 YEARS MUST END NOW.
THIS DEFEAT OF NATO AND THE USA WILL ENSURE THE FUTURE OF PEACE BY CLEARLY DEMONSTRATING THAT DIRECT AMERICAN AGGRESSION AS IN AFGHANISTAN OR BY PROXI AS IN UKRAINE CAN ONLY LEAD TO DEFEAT.   
AFTER RUSSIA'S TOTAL VICTORY OVER NATO AND UKRAINE, RUSSIA WILL HAVE TO HOMOGENEIZE THE POPULATIONS, WHICH WILL IMPLY THE DISPLACEMENT OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. THE EAST AND SOUTH HALF WILL BE ALLOCATED TO RUSSIAN SPEAKER AND THOSE WHO WANT TO LIVE WITH RUSSIANS. THE ANTI-RUSSIAN UKRAINIANS WILL HAVE TO BE DEPORTED TO THE NORTH-WEST PART WHICH WILL BE EQUAL TO APPROXIMATELY ONE-FIFTH OF CURRENT TERRITORY WHICH WILL REMAIN UNDER RUSSIAN INFLUENCE.

For example: CIA + MI6 + Norway + Germany + Ukraine together blew up Nord Stream pipeline; drone attack on Kremlin; another drone attacks on civilian targets in Moscow without any military targets near; terrorist attack with explosive hidden in e-scooter against a general and his bodyguard in civilian area Moscow; another hidden explosive in civilian area in Moscow. And this is just like a scratch on the surface. The Ukrainians are deliberately targeting civilians in civilian areas deep in Russia with the only goal to make the people angry hoping to provoke them to turn against Putin. But what this complete ¡d¡oтs just can't understand is that they are only uniting them, bringing them all together, more and more, making Russian people stronger, resilient, motivated and willing to fight. Duмв NATO MTHRFCKRS! And they can't even realize that the same ""bad"" man, that they want to get rid of, is exactly the one who is keeping them all safe and sound, saving their pathetic miserable lives with his strong personality and his influence and control over the some of the hardliners and other influential and powerful generals keeping them satisfied and in check not to even think about overthrowing him, mobilizing the whole mighty Russian army and running over every single barking little puppy standing on their pathway to Berlin once again. Or just dealing with all the annoying bugs with RS-28 repellent. 1 for Germany, 1 for France, 1 for Scandinavia, and 1/3 for England. Everything will already be over even before it starts. From the thought in his head, to the words coming from his mouth forming an order, to the learned through countless drills mechanical action of the soldier, who reaches out with his hand and presses the red🚨button, which says, ""ride⚡it"", then from the launch of the missile to the bright ball of light erasing London, and to the total annihilation of England - 4min. 44sec. All you Western bureaucrats, political activists, government officials, political representatives, presidents, prime-ministers, ""Kings"" and ""Queen"", it's about time to finally wake the фu©к up and understand the simple situation and truth. Now, please concentrate and listen very carefully... President of Russia Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin is the only kind of Russian leader-guarantor that such a development will not happen. Unless collective you try to bend him over just like you tried recently and we all know the results of this genius plan of yours.

1. We are ALL sinners - (Rom. 6:23) For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;









*Sin separates us from the Holy God









2. There is a punishment for our sin -(Rom. 6:23a) For the wages of sin is death;








* Death - eternal death - HELL









3. God loves us, He does not want us to go to Hell, He provided a way for our escape from Hell - (Rom. 5:8) But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.









* Because of God's love for us, He sent his only son Jesus Christ to die in our place on the cross. Jesus Christ took all the weight of our sins so we can be saved through grace, NOT our works.









* The blood that Jesus shed on the cross can wash away our sins and make us clean









4. Through Jesus Christ, we can now have eternal life in HEAVEN - (Rom. 6:23b) but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.









*Gift - free, but you can only have it if you receive it. If you reject it then the punishment of Hell is waiting for you









5. How can I receive eternal life? - (Rom. 10:9) That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 









* You have to admit you are a sinner and you cannot save yourself from Hell nor go to Heaven through your own efforts.








 You have to believe in your heart that Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins, was buried and rose again after 3 days and that He and only He can save you from hell.









(Roman 10:13) For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  









* Whosoever means anyone including me and you! 









Do you want to do it? Pray this prayer:









Dear God, I admit I am a sinner and cannot save myself from hell. I believe that Jesus Christ died for my sins, was buried and rose again. I believe that only  Jesus Christ can save me from Hell and He is the only way to Heaven.  I accept Jesus Christ in my heart as my Lord and Savior. Thank You for eternal life. Amen.

A slowpoke from the White House

Donald Trump, literally in the first days of his presidency, promised to stop the bloodshed in Ukraine and save thousands of people from death. As a thrifty owner and businessman, for whom America is above all else, Trump was concerned about America's spending on military aid to Ukraine. He did not care at all under what conditions the war would stop and a peace treaty would be signed between the aggressor and the victim. I believe Trump planned to benefit from the peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine. Having already had experience communicating with Putin, and apparently knowing him as a smart and calculating politician, Trump decided to put pressure on Zelensky first and invited him to the White House in the hope that under the threat of ending military aid, he would be able to persuade the young green politician to make concessions. However, Trump was very wrong, Zelensky surprisingly turned out to be a tough nut to crack, who made it clear to the American businessman that he was not going to trade Ukrainian territory.

However, Zelensky's unsuccessful visit also had a positive side for Ukraine, because against the backdrop of Trump's threat to interrupt arms supplies to Ukraine, EU countries realized the need to ensure Ukraine's victory in its war with fascist Russia on their own. And after three months, Trump also realized the futility of simply persuading to end the bloodshed. Moreover, in order not to look like a lost sheep, Trump abandoned his threat to suspend arms supplies to Ukraine. At the same time, on May 12, European leaders and Trump issued an ultimatum demanding a ceasefire along the entire front line for 30 days and to begin peace talks without delay, otherwise tougher sanctions would be imposed on Russia. Trump promised to transfer weapons to Ukraine in quantities sufficient to defeat the Russian army if Putin refused direct negotiations.

It seems that this time Putin, who had been counting on a split between America and the EU, was seriously scared for the first time, so much so that without waiting for the next day, he urgently gathered his servants at 2 a.m. and announced his intention to start direct negotiations with Ukraine on May 15 in Istanbul. However, Putin did not say a word about a 30-day truce. Zelensky, in turn, immediately announced his readiness for a personal meeting with Putin. Here Putin, without expecting it, fell into a trap that he himself had set. It must be said that Putin avoided any debates and, unlike other presidential contenders, never took part in them during the election campaign. It is not difficult to foresee that during a face-to-face meeting, the former comedian showman will devour him alive, especially in the presence of Erdogan and Trump himself, who could not miss an opportunity to get some extra PR, who made him want to fly to such a significant event. Such a prospect was clearly not in the calculation of the Kremlin dictator. Well, what can he tell the whole world - I want war? After all, only war, and preferably a victorious one, reliably ensures his stay on the royal throne. Peace in the current circumstances is like death for Putin. The Russian people, impoverished by the war, with their imperial worldview, will not forgive the Fuhrer for his unfulfilled dreams of reviving the empire and the many thousands of soldiers who died in vain. Naturally, Putin at the last moment refused to meet with Zelensky and belatedly sent negotiators to Istanbul who do not have any authority, with the sole purpose of dragging out these negotiations for as long as possible.

How this childishly naive trick of Putin will be perceived depends entirely on Trump, who, I hope, will finally understand his mistake in thinking that the war can be stopped through negotiations without defeating the aggressor. Trump could have really saved thousands of lives if, upon entering the White House, he had not repeated Biden's mistake of supplying weapons in small doses, but had immediately ordered the transfer of weapons to Ukraine in the quantities necessary for victory. Only a convincing victory for Ukraine can thwart Putin's revanchist plans to restore the Russian Empire within the borders of the Soviet Union.

And now the Green T Shirt has arrived in Istanbul for no reason except a photo op, pathetic.  Of course Putin was never going to go to Istanbul to sit at a table whilst the coked up Green T Shirt has a little rant making sure his UK SAS bodyguards are close by just in case, then he can stomp out and make another little video of him 'ACTING' (very 3rd rate hammy acting at that) hard, insulting Putin then legging it quick. Naturally Russia had no intention of going along with this, what is interesting is that its the exact same negotiating team who Putin sent in March 2022. The only difference now is that Ukraine have lost 4 Oblasts since then and if they don't agree to Putin's conditions they're going to lose at least another 4.",@seanmcelroy5522,2025-05-15T11:54:11Z,1.0

vzGqN89ifBI,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"Seriously? You're playing videos that are 1-2 years old. Is everything that bad? 6:36 In the full video, by the way, this Bradley also pulled over to the side of the road, but it is not known if anyone survived there. Most likely, only the driver survived. 9:23 This tank, for the record, survived at least 4 drones in the total number that remained behind the scenes. And yes, these are 2 or 3 videos where you can see how the tank crew runs out of NATO equipment. So we can only guess how many people survived in Abrams, Leopards, and Challengers, because Ukraine does not want to say how many crews were lost.",@XWJWeu332,2025-05-19T12:43:59Z,0.0

vzGqN89ifBI,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"I don't believe that anyone really believes in such poorly glued videos. Well, if we talk about tanks, the T-90M is much better suited for modern warfare. Firstly, the T-90M costs 3 times less than the Leopard 2A7, 3 times less than the Abrams M1A2 and 4 times less than the Challenger 2. Secondly, the T-90 has a better roof reservation, which occupies almost the entire upper part of the tank, which helps a lot in the fight against drones. That's what we've seen in practice. There is a video where the T-90M withstands 7 or 11 hits from airborne drones and still remains alive.",@BRIKS512,2025-05-17T19:47:33Z,0.0

In russian tanks due to the usage of autoloader, the ammunition is stored in a carousel around the turret so it all explodes launching the turret up in the air. Let's clarify that russian tanks were designed with a different tactics in mind where during cold war they assumed that they need a swarm of cheap small tanks that would push forward in waves regardless of the loses. If crew and vehicles are disposable, that would be a valid tactic at that time. But not when you use them as infantry support in small numbers.

vzGqN89ifBI,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"what i have seen from Ukraine Leopard Tank Crews, the capabilities are highly exceeding the written official numbers, the range for example exceeded the expectations by far with 100 percent accuracy over the stated numbers. As a German who worked for different ministries, i can tell you why you will see such a difference. You can't legally use numbers that could differ under some circumstances, if we say 100 percent accuracy up to X Km under perfect conditions, it won't be accepted. You have to either state number's for the different condition's or state the number that would work under every condition. 

Major differnces between Western Tank's and other's. Aside from being build with the crew in mind, you have way higher reserve speed, you don't need to turn and expose weaker parts of  the Armor. The Tanks are also more like Sniper's in field, the range and accuracy are greater.",@martinbergen2963,2025-05-11T00:15:59Z,0.0

Because munition for the autoloader is stored in the turret basked you can't create any safety modules that will save the crew, when it comes to western MBT's the ammunition is sitting in a metal can that has blast doors which redirect fire outside the vehicle making it safe for the crew. That means ALL tanks will suffer to drones but crews of the western ones will have a high chance of surviving and getting another one unlike the russians, but who cares if they can assign an untrained 18yo crew and send it for death?",@keffisiontko,2025-05-10T22:02:36Z,0.0

And when they are confronted by real tanks, they quickly turn their stocks into a junkyard. We’ve seen that before. 

Looks like the Ukrainian armory forces are getting more and more familiar with the western sophistication and are even mastering their skills in their implementation.",@PURELUCIDITY,2025-05-10T12:49:11Z,0.0

What gets on my nerves, however, are gimmicky clips of old footage that give the impression that what is shown happened in exactly the same chronological order.

All the more so when nobody makes an effort with this fictional storytelling to make mistakes in terms of seasons and tank models. Selling a Challenger as a Leopard 2A6 is really lousy.",@antonialindenberg1889,2025-05-10T12:40:38Z,0.0

vzGqN89ifBI,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"4:37 To be fair, it is entirely the fault of the auto loader design in these Russian tanks that causes this. Leopards and Abrams tanks can have a separated ammo compartment so that if it goes up in flames the chances of the crew being affected is minimal. But because the Russian tanks use a carousel type autoloader it is impossible to separate the crew entirely from the ammo (at least in most cases) because it's usually right behind or under the turret basket. Which is why they are famous turret launchers.",@tmaster3332,2025-05-10T01:26:40Z,1.0

Be honest - none country in the last 130 years hold huge land and won partisan war. If Russians capturr Kyiev in 2 months, then it is doable, but hatred and damage was done. And yea - it is destroyed Russian economy (goverment pay 10% of price of Tank, Tank company must loan 90% with 20% loan).

vzGqN89ifBI,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"There are 3 different fire events.  One is the fuel.  It is diesel and stored both internally, and externally.  You can see it leaking on the ground , on fire, running downhill.  Fire suppression systems have a chance putting out this fire.  The next is 'gunpowder', or more correctly, a propellent fire.  This is signaled by the 'blowtorch flames' shooting out the tank.  Russian tanks have this inside the crew compartment, not isolated like the Abrams, etc.  Once this conflagration starts, it feeds on the next piece of ammunition.  The crew has mere moments to get out.  Fire suppression is not helpful.  The worst event is the detonation of the ammunition's projectiles.  The High Explosive in both HE and HEAT shells evidently can 'cook off' from both a propellent fire, or being actually struck by a penetration, or sympathetically from a drones explosion.  This leads to a triple event of fuel, propellant, and high explosives all getting consumed and the vehicle being ripped apart, and turrets, etc. flying about.  In WWII, the Soviets used very sensitive explosives in their shells.  I would bet they still do.

This is the new generation of IFVs, the Bradley and Abrams as well as the Leo2 are more than 40 years old. Can create an artillery barrage on its own up to 8.5km
This gun also exists in a non intrusive CIWS/C-RAM turret named rapid-fire that surely can be mounted on the top of an APC, like the brother of the EBRC, the VBMR Griffon. Thales is finalizing an active protection system named PROMETEUS to intercept incoming ATGMs, shells or drones before they hit.

He must think Ukraine is stupid and expect them to stop drones for him, I hope they really messed it up. Those countries that attended are just as bad as him.

His Troops showed no mercy for the Russian People.  He underestimated Russian resolve to resist (and eventually win).

MyO3ObbxxeM,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"Le plan est malin. En attaquant des usines avant le défiler et en menaçant d'attaquer pendant le défiler, l'Ukraine met Moscou dans une positions où quoiqu'elle fasse elle sera perdante. Je m'explique. Poutine peut avoir deux réactions face aux menaces de l'Ukraine. 

1 : Il met en place une défense très importante sur Moscou et se concentre essentiellement sur le défilé. Mais se faisant ça laissera le champ Libre à l'Ukraine pour attaquer durement beaucoup d'autre point stratégique.
2. Poutine ne prend pas au sérieux les menaces de l'Ukraine et continue son défilé avec une défense standard importante mais pas exceptionnelle. Ce qui laissera le champ libre aux ukrainiens d'attaquer durement Moscou pendant le défilé.

Dans les deux cas Poutine est dans une position inconfortable parce que quoiqu'il fasse il subira une attaque puissante. Je ne serais pas surpris que les forces ukrainienne est été déjà mise en place pour l'attaque d'aujourd'hui. N'attendant que les renseignement sur la défense mise en places par la Russie pour choisir quel cibles attaqués.

Russia couldnt afford to ignore these drones as they wont know if the do or dont have warheads in. If I had production/fund limits this is what i'd do for example, launch 99 unarmed drones + 1 armed drone. let russia exhaust 100 missiles for a tiny cost, and maybe even get a strike on the target but keep russia guessing as theres a warhead in there somewhere so they cant ignore them.

If after a few launches they stop intercepting them then launch 100 armed drones on the chance they also get ignored.

Its not exactly a new tactic but not sure why its not being used more heavily in this conflict were the cost of arms is a big factor.",@thatgamingbrit,2025-05-09T07:48:34Z,0.0

They believe this is a deterant but we struck the deal with Ukraine for rare earth minerals to make more semiconductor chips, wich means providing security for Ukraine in the area. any future conflicts with China are reduced. Russia now gets to choose to go home or attack Americans in Ukraine and fight a real army plus 34 other nations. Once Russia directly attacks any American mining in Ukraine or their security that's a threat to a NATO nation. They will be mobilized against Russia.

MyO3ObbxxeM,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"At the time of Ukraine’s independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine held the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world, including an estimated 1,900 strategic warheads, 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and 44 strategic bombers. By 1996, Ukraine had returned all of its nuclear warheads to Russia in exchange for economic aid and security assurances, and in December 1994, Ukraine became a non-nuclear weapon state-party to the 1968 nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). The last strategic nuclear delivery vehicle in Ukraine was eliminated in 2001 under the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). It took years of political maneuvering and diplomatic work, starting with the Lisbon Protocol in 1992, to remove the weapons and nuclear infrastructure from Ukraine.",@richardcuttler7734,2025-05-09T04:54:08Z,0.0

MyO3ObbxxeM,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"The bias of this vlog is typical but did no favors to the Zelenskyy regime -- rather the opposite, especially as the non-president was so smug and sneering in his presentation. It can be viewed in full on many sites.
The Russian idea of a 3 day cease fire for the 80th anniversary of VE Day during a claimed 30 day sort of cease fire declared by Kiev, which even EU elite figures had no belief in, could be seen as equally unrealistic.
Given Kiev's thirst for headlines, the Kremlin cast several lures at once. The parade and days leading up to it, the cancellation/postponement of the Black Sea celebration and not using jamming of US and ESA satellites at the weapons factories at surface level. I was reminded of British tactics in late 1944 when dummy planes and armored vehicles were moved about a bit so Nazi recon photographs showed apparent assets in various stages of preparation/maintenance.
To be eve more convincing if Goering's remnants made attacks, the RAF used old oil and tyres to burn to confuse attackers and, above all, obscure large areas. Attacking aircraft were brought down or not to leave enough to reach home and confuse commanders more thoroughly. This less to carelessness in signaling and decryption became easier and regular RAF night bombing of Germany continued but USAAF and RCAF B-24s with Mustangs and Hurricanes making day attacks on retreating German forces, led by RAF Mosquito dawn marker aircraft in large quantities, some using new transponder marking instead of fire across large fronts.
In these days of drone use [given by the USA etc for defense] it was easy for Russia to predict where drones and long range rockets would be aimed at. 
The phrase ""appropriate response"" is not the same as equal response because Russia will not simply launch drones but use a mix of weapons for surgical strikes and where Kiev stores and even makes some drones as well as the armor repair hubs from the north, east, south and parallel to the Polish border import points.
Possibly, Russia will shorten the skirmishing time on the Pokrovsk front with quite cheap thermobaric bombing from OTH helicopters and Su-25s then the waiting armored columns will make for Dnipro city for talks but it is unlikely that its oblast will be added to the 'fraternal 4' for new capital reasons. Dnipro city is a good site for an administrative capital of Ukraine Mk 2.",@stephenhall3515,2025-05-09T02:40:05Z,0.0

MyO3ObbxxeM,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"What's important is that ruzzia did *NOT* liberate Europe from Nazis in WW2...quite the opposite. The German army, mainly pensioners and children because this late in the war, most of the men were already dead, was on ruzzian soil and about to take Moscow. Ruzzia with the homefield advantage was losing to a much smaller and much, MUCH lesser equipped german army. So Stalin went begging to the west for aid. The USA supplied ruzzia with hundreds of billions of dollars (in 2025 dollars) in fuel, weapons, machinery and even food...yes, ruzzia couldn't even provide their people with food that's how incompetent they were/are. But even *WITH* this help, the ruzzians were STILL losing to the german army. So Stalin once again came out begging. This time the allieds decided to spread out the german army's attention by opening up a second front...on the west coast of France in a small town called Normandy....Perhaps you've heard of it? It was called D-Day! Yes. With tremendous effort and with the intention of saving ruzzia's ass, the allieds went all in, and it worked! The now even more weakened german army in moscow was now easier to defeat for even the ruzzians to complete the mission and they were able to save Moscow...Stalin later wrote in his memoirs, that ""if it hadn't been for the United States and it's machines of war, ruzzia would have surely falled to the german army""...yes, that's how close it was. So ruzzia *DIDN'T* defeat the nazis...at least not on their own...the only reason they're not speaking German now is because of the combined efforts of the USA, Britain, Canada and France!",@ekummel,2025-05-09T02:26:32Z,0.0

I can see the strategy of scaring Russians... but long term think: Why would you aim a missile anywhere near the 2nd/1st most powerful military's leader that has remained REASONABLY hands off(less than the U.S I argue) They must have figured/calculated it worth the potential shift in stance from China. I'll end by saying perhaps they think China is so focused on the pacific/Tai Wan, they don't believe they'd risk 2 wars/fronts within half a decade. Also, if I was Russia, yea, I've lost alot of young men and boys to this war, as we tend to do. ""Oh look,  a U.S made Ukrainian launched missile on our capital! Putin was right!""

Firstly....CCCP was Nazi ally 1939....till jun 1941.
Then...proportionaly, there was more ukrainians then russians.....died in WW2.
But allso, without USA and UK material and other suport......Russia should be in much harder positione.

MyO3ObbxxeM,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"Well, for one thing, I'd bet that ""massive drone wave"" was a mostly intended as a test of Moskow's air defenses - older models that are past their ""best sued by"" dates, surplus, or otherwise unfit for frontline duty. Ukraine probably just wanted to light up all the radar sites so that, as the US did recently in Yemen, all sorts of electronic ""ears"" could map their GPS locations to within a meter, plus draining the Russians stockpiles of anti-air missiles in preparation for a HARD drone wave of ""the best & brightest"" smart drones during the May Day parade tomorrow (May 9th). I don't think this was the main attack; this was just a full scale test of the enemy's defenses in depth, to see what they'll be up against tomorrow.

MyO3ObbxxeM,,,,,,,,,,,comment,Ukraine is just demonstrating that it can attack anywhere in Russia whenever it wants. The Ukrainians are unlikely to bother with the parade as it is being attended by civilians. But a major attack either before or after the parade on military targets is extremely likely. They are only wanting to hit military objectives and won't waste ammunition on civilian targets.

My problem with you is that making these claims as if they are facts takes away from your credibility. Next time a video of yours comes in the recommended list with the same again, I will set the channel for YT to not recommend.

Ningún país puede tomar el territorio de otro país por la fuerza. De hecho, la Unión Europea entendió muy bien eso: ""debemos dejar de pelearnos por el territorio y aprender a vivir en paz"".

Cuando gobiernos como China, Brasil o India apoyan al gobierno de Rusia en su invasión, están creando más inestabilidad en el mundo y su comportamiento es inaceptable.

Pero también han ocurrido cosas que debilitan la justicia internacional y esas cosas deben corregirse.

La justicia es esencial.

No hay ningún motivo para la invasión de Rusia a Ucrania, simplemente robo de territorio.

Por que Ucrania quiere estar en la NATO? Por la misma razón que otros países ya están en NATO: Rusia NO es confiable. Rusia es una amenaza. Es un peligro ser vecino de Rusia.

wFhpVSgmm2I,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"The Russian Federation will lose this war for a very obvious reason, the BRICS countries are weaker and backward. The Russian Federation does not function in a way that here now you want it, it only functions and broadcasts on ""FANTASTIC"" television from Moscow, but this is a world of visions and delusions. Russian production of military equipment is not impressively large ""AS FOR THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CURRENT WAR, WHAT WE HAVE HERE AND NOW"". The Russian Federation does not function indefinitely. And that something is shown on propaganda television from Moscow, it is only shown, they are happy because they gave them hope, the reality is worse. The television theory and reality, it is really something completely different!!!!!!! The G7 countries provide greater possibilities for now. The BRICS countries are not able to produce the appropriate amount of military equipment for a specific time, on top of that they are technologically backward. Therefore, in any number of years the Russian Federation will definitely not win this war. There will be more and more war mercenaries. You Russians are dying unnecessarily. But this is already a certain, wrong ideological idea. Here, certain hunter schemes should come out in order to save a larger number of people. But this will not work in old or new Russia, so they die unnecessarily, gaining nothing for themselves, except only losses. As for the acquisition of a small area of ​​Ukrainian land in 3 years, where the number of dead Russian soldiers is slowly approaching 740,000. Your comrade Joseph Stalin made a record, he caused the deaths of 24,000,000 Russians in various circumstances. The Ukrainian land acquired for the Russian Federation will be almost imperceptible in comparison to the vastness of the largest country in the world, so one should think before the war (???). Except that this is Russia, so as always Russians must die in any large number with or without sense (???). Warmest regards! Herman Knippenberg.",@HermanKnippenberg-r4w,2025-05-17T08:51:53Z,0.0

1S8HTZOt4Us,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"I also like to thank President Putin for reminding me, how skimpy I been of the most powerful figure in my cast, Medina (Medinsky). When I first looked at the news I sat my eyes on meteorologist Natasha but as time went by my attention shifted to Medina and for logical reasons not only was she exceptionally attractive, she had my mother's maiden name as well, so I brought her into my cast.( Within the Medinsky context I reiterate my mother's name is Lydia, therefore the Lydians)and endowed Natasha as well as Medina with supernatural powers but by far Medina was to become omnipotent for her powers where increasing with time and was making not only the deities in the stories uneasy but among the opposition as well (Let's called it conjecture for now because there's no hard evidence)but, previously I provided the first clue. The second clue would be another elementary school named Smythe whose color was painted light green at the end of Madrid street. I like to point out that I used that word as a replacement for smite, when buddy and 86 went to meet the monster buddy uttered "" look for the weakest side and smythe at the most opportune time"". And the question that is raised is why light green? Because when Medina showed up at 86's doorstep and  offered a cup of tea was December the 14 when the Virgin of Guadalupe is celebrated...Best wishes to my friends.",@BenjaminCuriel-uw1td,2025-05-16T06:14:00Z,0.0

With Zelensky visibly ""wired"" most of the time he is belligerent and beyond reason.   Zelensky needs to be put under house arrest, the law forbidding Ukrainians to dialogue and negotiate with Russia changed urgently and a new sound negotiating team sent - they will succeed but with Zelensky there will be no end to the war he created.. he knows when war ends so does he..

Of course , witnessing the failure of the EU is disheartening, and it is widely acknowledged that the primary reason lies in the short-sightedness of individual EU countries, each prioritizing their own benefits without considering others. Every outcome has its underlying reasons. Had the EU taken decisive action at the onset of the war, Russia might have already been defeated.

Minerals are spotted and he negotiates with Ukraine to repay back the loan and let America take all its mineral. America realizes they need peace to get the minerals from Ukraine and they push Russia to accept a peace deal. Ukraine president can’t even wear a suite.,@oluochokello.j9366,2025-05-15T16:55:30Z,0.0

ttb3Iwx0W7c,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"Has anybody been in a Turkish bazaar to purchase a carpet. You deal with the salesperson, see what he has to offer and the prices. You select one and offer a price at least a third of the asking one. He shakes his head and disappears into a backroom to speak with the boss. He comes back and gives a revised price lower than the original. Again you now offer half of the asking. He shakes his head - and so we go on until the buyer and seller agree through the salesman. Then outcomes the owner, takes the cash and offer the customer a cup of cardamom or hibiscus tea. In this Ukraine game we don’t know who is the seller and who is the customer. But be sure you won’t see either of them together in the same room drinking tea until the deal is agreed on. Trump is behaving as the banker who is,looking at both as his customers and making sure he is the one who gets the best deal.",@mambaman9363,2025-05-15T16:43:51Z,0.0

Matthew 24:6 reads: ""Then you will certainly hear of battles and next the sounds of battles being fought (this indicates that the current war in Ukraine will escalate). Be careful not to be afraid (this in turn indicates that this war will spread to other countries, escalating to a very dangerous form (with the use of tactical nuclear weapons; cf. Am 5:8,9) for everything must come to pass (meaning: to be fulfilled - Jesus here refers to Da 11:29a) but the fulfillment (implicitly: of the sign) is not yet there–this means that the U.S will not get directly involved in this war, and the strategic nuclear weapon will not be used yet.)""

According to Daniel 11:29a we will see Russia (depicted as 'the king of the north') RETURN. This means that Russia will again have military bases where it had previously.",@lnaird,2025-05-15T16:18:20Z,0.0

Boris Yeltsin goal is have a

But Boris Yeltsin choose a wrong person Vladimir Putin boris Yeltsin promise Vladimir Putin to keep his legacy and Freedom and democracy after Vladimir Putin become president Vladimir Putin tried to shift reversing into democracy to authoritarianism rulers 

Vladimir Putin goals is have 

Restrict media
Lack of human rights 
Fair election 
Protest and activist and independent are excile and torture 
No freedom of speech 

But the government tried to overthrow Vladimir Putin but they silent because of fear Vladimir Putin hate USA and western Europe but the government still not hate USA and western Europe because government know boris Yeltsin tried to build new relation and allies

Satan and his fallen Angels fought God’s angels to overthrow God but were defeated and were thus thrown out of heaven to the earth (Isaiah14:12-14 AND Revelation 12:7-10). Satan and his fallen Angels will be thrown into hell to be tormented 24/7 forever and ever (Revelation 20:10 AND Jude 1:7). Satan and his fallen Angels want you to join them and suffer in hell even though you were not part of the coup makers (Revelation 20:10-15). Satan, and for that matter his fallen Angels stand condemned by God and hence do not have any chance of repentance(John 16:11). Fortunately, you and I have up to minutes before our death to repent just like the criminal on the right side of Jesus Christ on the cross (Luke 23:39-43) WHY NOT REPENT NOW AND GIVE YOUR LIFE TO JESUS?

Trump knew Putin won't go unless Trump was going there personally, power houses know what makes them look weak that's why Trump knew sending US delegation was only going to be met with a russian delegation. The only place a US not a wetern or Ukrainan delegation would have a small change of meeting Putin himself would be in Moscow and not any other country. Trump knows that, Xi knows that and Putin knows that (the power houses towards each other know they don't play weak but either of these 3: strategic, strong or mutual cards). With China, it's easier to have its delegations meet Putin in another country if it just so happens that Putin is around while on another business trip (NOTE: not traveling there extra to meet Chinese delegation). They both have had a good and respectful relationship for long and would be meeting on common grounds and not conflict, for US it's a bit difficult coz we know US has for long been using condescending tone and using force against Russia coz they thought Russia has to bow down to them, which doesn't put them in the same friendly position as China's delegations and except for the few chosen US persons, Putin would only deal face to face with a US presidents and not anyone lower. That is why Trump won't respond much to the expectation of those who don't understand that and thought Putin would bow down to Zelensky or western leaders ultimatum. It would be a big win for Zelensky to make Putin bow to his or any other western leaders' pressure and do what they wish. Only Xi or Trump going to Istanbul and on respectful terms not pressure or ultimatums would make Putin make the effort. We know Xi and Putin handle each other with mutual respect all the time since we know them as leaders of their countries. Trump apparently knows very well he has to stay away from condescending tone if he wants to have any conversation with Putin. Biden used harsh tones and it got him nowhere, western Europe still use tough tone and beat chest even though they've achieved nothing with it for years now other than make their countries' economy harder to bear. Tough tone won't get them anywhere but they still can't see that and move around like lost flock following the comedian, they'll learn that sooner or later. Then they will start talking about giving Russia what it first demanded because by the time they realize they'll get nowhere with chest beating, they'll have lost more but they'll have to settle with what would have been left or lose even more😂😂.

What’s wrong with those people? Funny how Trump’s babushkas are exactly like Putin’s babushkas.

What I honestly don’t understand is why the media continues to do this. If they just reported honestly, all they would have to do is state the many other instances where he does it. Is the media really that fearful? It’s so wrong.",@newfamilyhome,2025-05-15T08:03:58Z,0.0

ttb3Iwx0W7c,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"Neither the media or the general public understands what is happening here! The fact is the Russian completed the construction of the Kerch Bridge from the Russian mainland to Crimea in 2018 without seeking approval of Ukraine. The Kerch Bridge provides the military logistic key to supply Russian troops in Crimea and those operating in south east Ukraine. The west has had the military capability  to destroy the use of the Kerch Bridge since its completion yet has refused to provide Ukraine with these means to do so even today. The west programme of military aid to Ukraine has been a deliberate and carefully measured response by holding back key weapons systems from HIMARS, tanks, military aircraft, long range missiles in full knowledge that the longer the war proceeded the most likely outcome would be the collapse of the small Russian economy. This fact was always a understood from its beginning in 2014 and on into 2022 with previous known understanding of western intelligence agencies of the Russia invasion of Ukraine in 2022.  Yet at no time has the West supplied cruise missiles capable disrupting Russian supply logistics over the Kerch Bridge. 


The logistic length of supply of military resources over the Kerch Bridge is 18 kilometres from the Russian main land to Crimea,  without the Kerch it would become over 800 kilometres and untenable. The question is why has it not been rendered inoperable?  The only logical answer is the actual history of the war supply chain by the West including its refusal to supply the military means to destroy the use of the bridge and thus ending the war at least in Crimea and the South Eastern parts of Ukraine.  The only reasonable conclusion is to deliberately ensure the war continues to the extent of Russian economic collapse in league with the  political intrigue disposed by of the West. Of course it meant Ukraine pays the price for defeat of Russia that has been a source of massive expense to the west for over 100 years. So the fact is Putin was known not show to himself in Turkey given the universal warrant for his arrest and the understood fact that  Putin cannot sue for peace having butchered almost one million Russian soldiers.

Security Council: Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, and other nations including Belarus, Canada, Germany, Israel,
Poland and Turkey.
Peace deal broke down due to no discussion on returning Crimea to Ukraine. It would, however, seek EU membership. Among other points of disagreement in the 2022 negotiations was Russia's demand for deep cuts to the size of Ukraine's armed forces and the number of its tanks, missiles, warplanes and other weapons.
The U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War wrote in an analysis that the terms of the Istanbul protocol draft would have left Ukraine helpless to defend itself against any future threat from Russia.""
Nothing has changed from Putin's demands in 2025, except he wants to keep more territory and for NO countries to provide security guarantees to Ukraine.

ttb3Iwx0W7c,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"Trump's concept of a negotiated “peace deal” with Putin is impossible. Trump’s ‘stated’ humanitarian goal to ‘stop the killing’ is wholly incompatible with Putin’s stated goal to subjugate Ukraine and Moldava.  Then, he can realize his new and improved ‘Soviet Union’ vision which will include the [old] Soviet republics of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and the European Cold War satellite states such as Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, and perhaps even the [old] DDR. An ambitious project! With Finland and Sweden feeling the heat, they recently joined NATO (with American support.) Allowing Putin to pursue his ‘grand’ concept will mean war with ‘junkyard’ Europe. Therefore, Putin MUST lose.

Here is what will happen now.

Ukraine has been weakened, they have lost their citizens, their soldiers, their losses have been large, their population can no longer support.

The west has allowed North Korea to fight with Russia yet have provided restricted support not wanting to escalate, WHAT A JOKE.

The west have relieved their Military Stockpiles of all of their garbage, the US has restricted what could be allowed to Ukraine and how it could be used, the West has exhausted Ukraine, Russia has not stopped, have not gone away. 

The West, because they have handled this so poorly, will now have to align themselves to prepare for war against Russia, possibly with Ukraine on the side of Russia when the ceasefire comes to effect and then, Putin takes Kiev and all of Ukraine.  Ukraine will become part of Russia, the West, your sons, your daughters, your mothers and fathers, will be fighting against Ukraine.  Ukraine will develop their new weapons to use against the West, that will be Devastating.  The West will also lose to Russia.  Russia will become the largest military in the world, Because the West does not want to risk escalation.    In 20 years, the History Books will look much different now than they would have had the west stood up to Russia 3 years ago.

Based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.

If NATO gets particularly creative with a new definition of what counts as ""defence"", many NATO countries could also see their official figures rise substantially without actually spending an additional cent.

ttb3Iwx0W7c,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"Once again CNN has it wrong - please do some proper analysis. Putin did not propose to go to the talks himself but to send an exploratory team to Istanbul. As in normal diplomacy he is sending a team to work through discussions leading to a stoppage of combat eventually. Once all details are figured out, foreign ministers will meet and perhaps a ceasefire arranged and only after that, if peace is agreed, will heads of state meet. This is the correct process.

It was Zelensky who declared that he would go to Istanbul, but that he would not engage with the Russian delegation, but only with Putin - who was never going to attend anyway. Zelensky, who has no desire for peace unless he wins in negotiations what he is losing on the battlefield, knows that Putin will not turn up, will declare Putin does not want peace and will score a mere media victory (only in the West) while he continues to lose men and territory on the battlefield. It seems this war will only end on the battlefield.",@BrentonBeach-wt7nu,2025-05-15T00:53:18Z,0.0

ttb3Iwx0W7c,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"These comments are hilarious! Putin NEVER once said that he would be attending those talks. He told Ukraininans that if they want permanent peace (and not just a ceasefire that would give them a chance to re-arm) to meet on Thursday in Istanbul and CONTINUE the talks from April 2022, but based on REALITIES on the ground. In April 2022 Ukraine and Russia agreed to peace and initialed the agreement which wouldve prevented bloodshed and Ukraine wouldve kept everything except Crimea. The next day Boris Johnson flew to Kiev and made sure that the agreement was broken!
Now, if there is an agreement, Ukraine will be forced to give 20-25% of its territory! 

Ukraine NEVER had a chance to win this war! Only complete idiots thought otherwise. They were used to destabilize Russia and pushed into inevitable destruction. May Ukrainian mothers forgive those naive/stupid people who pushed Ukrainian young men to their deaths just so that the military industrial complex shareholders can make some extra money!

Putin, and all representatives of their people, must bow to the authority, the abillity of self determination, the liberty, of the people, and hear what this is through the determinations of democracy.  There is no national interest, and there is no authority of state, that is divested of the interests and authority of the people who compries the nation.  Representatives represent the people they serve, they do not replace them.  We are not electing kings.  We the People are the fundamental and ultimate democratic authority, from which all represenative authority derives, and without which no representative authority would exist.

In my opinion, nationalism is superficial.

He cannot back down and never will and he's duped everyone concerned using Lavrovian diplomatic skills to the fullest. The Russians want Ukraine as a price and Putin will not stop until he wins or the fates do and he loses in one way or another. The next Russian President will use the same tactics and we will fall for his false promises, too. Russians have a mindset that is different than ours.

Typically, peace negotiations are usually done by junior and middle level negotiators until some agreementis is arrived at. Heads of states only come in to sign the agreement once there is some agreement.

US EU and Zalenzki created this proxy war by pushing NATO to Russia's borders and encouraged Zalenzki to join EU membership. When Russia wanted peace negotiations EU Zalenzki and Boris Johnson especially stopped Russia signing the peace agreement although putin since 2022 pushed for peace negotiations. Now EU have run out of funds and Russia has systematically gained most of Ukrainian Land and the Ukrainians are being killed in large numbers Putin has won the war praise be to our Lord jesus Christ.  If US wants to start supplying more weapons there is no difference between Biden and Trump thats what the Biden administration did and sanctioned Russia and destroyed the Nord Stream and then supplied the US LNG to Europe. Now US wants  Ukrainian  minerals the war had nothing to do with Putin or Russia US all along with Lindsey Graham wanted to exploit the minerals fro Ukrain they never cared for Zalenzki or his nation that is why the US appointed a puppet Zalenzki and overthrow the democratically elected president of Ukraine.  Putin is blessed and protected by Jesus Christ himself this leader of Russia overcame all forms of harassment on his nation by the power of God, the sanctions and the sabotage on the Nor Stream but God is with him.

3. He banned 11 opposition parties from parliament and jailed Medvedchuk opposition leader
4. He eliminated all media except the state controlled outlets and arrested reporters.
5. He passed a law making negative reporting or reporting in support of Russia a crime.
6. He shut down the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, destroying churches beating/arresting priests 
7. He destroyed all Soviet area veteran memorials.
8. He has preserved museums and statues honoring a real Nazi Stepan Bandera.

Idiot as always! I think since Trump is not willing to help Ukraine financially in order to continue fighting against Russia, is better for the US to stay out of any future negotiations!

That treaty guaranteed Russia would pull out all military out of Eastern Ukraine and they could vote to be autonomous republics. Crimea would have remained Russian since it's population is over 60% Russian and the 2014 referendum voted to align with Russia. Before the 2014 war, The U.N. Development Organization conducted 3 polls from 2009-2011.  A 63%  majority favored aligning with Russia. After the start of the war in 2014,  a U.S. Gallup poll was conducted in Crimea in late 2014  and the 60%  majority favored aligning with Russia. The CIA created, color revolutions in 2004 were an attempt to overthrown the Ukrainian leadership that was friendly with Russia.

If Zelenskyy has a modicum of common sense he will stop criticising Putin and take the help of Trump totally and abide by his suggestions. By listening to others who have no skin in the game he is losing precious time and more Ukraine territory.  He must know it’s not Trump’s war. He only tries to help.

No big powerful country can  forcefully ursurp  & swallow up smaller vulnerable countries just because Russia being an aggressive warring nation, thinks it can easily &  tyrannically invade other countries' lands as Russia uses  brute strength to  illegally attack  & subdue other smaller nations!
 That Russia arbitrarily believes that  pure might & power is right & the  law of the jungle applies, that big powerful  countries can illegally attack smaller sovereign countries with impunities, with no compensation & heavy price to pay!
The whole free world would be endangered & in grave jeopardy if bigger  brutal strong countries  with no  governing  international law can  just simply swallow up other weaker smaller nations,  this will upend the  natural  & whole world order whereby  big countries can  illegally absorb each sovereign & independently recognized country!
Only  real cowards  will simply  & easily said with their cowardice actions , to just let have &  give Ukrainian lands to  tyrannical despot Putin,  & then we have peace !
As former  American President Ronald Regan said in one of his victory speeches, we have to stand up for what is right & rightfully ours, for independence & not yield to the  wilful will  power & pressures of brutal regimes who want to ursurp  smaller sovereign nations!
Trump dictated to Ukraine to just simply give  up Crimea to be legally recognized as Russian land, it's because by doing so,  he wants a quick solution to peace which is unfair to Ukraine  & bowing down by giving in to all of the evil blood thirsty murderous indicted war criminal despot, Putin's wishes &  dictated terms & not caring about Ukraine's welfare & future, that is, having a just & fair peace for Ukraine!
Imagine if Russia who sold Alaska to America on  18 Oct 1867 & if tyrannical  Russia now wants Alaska back because Russia now recognises the importance of the Artic region, would Trump just easily bow down to Putin's wishes &  willingly transferred Alaska over to Russia? 
Of course not! Trump would fight like hell against Putin to stop Putin from taking over Alaska, just as now Ukrainians are  now fighting  against Russia for illegally occupying Ukrainian territories, as  it is,  Ukraine is now fighting for its independence,  its sovereignty & right to existential survival!
Just because Ukraine's lands are invaded by Russia & not American lands invaded by  Russia,  Trump simply doesn't care two hoots  about Ukraine as Ukraine is not America's land, otherwise Trump would fight  Putin's Russia if Russia wants to tyrannically take back Alaska which was formerly Russian land!",@TanSiokPeng-pc3gq,2025-05-18T05:03:26Z,0.0

Putin has said ""it is important that we work together and settle this as neighbours and as brothers..to ensure we have a long lasting peace""... and this must be so. A better leader than Zelensky would have been wiser for Ukraine... and the question is asked, who has the power in Ukraine to sign off any agreement reached?

Greed is an unwholesome desire
A craving to obtain all desired by man.
Caused by gluttonous, ego and conceit
As we eagerly grasp everything we can.

Wealth, fame, power and libido
Are the trophies of what greed consists of.
A hunger to experience every exotic wish
Overpowering the glory of love.

Twisted by pursuing all, which is wrong
Our compassion becomes self-serving.
We ‘re tormented by mistrust, suspicion and rage
And our downfall as a human is deserving.

RHk_gYw9smA,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"**War Between Russia and Poland: Historical Context**

The war between Russia and Poland lasted for 196 years — from the 15th to the 17th century. Formally, the conflict never truly ended, despite numerous truces that sometimes lasted 5, 10, or even 25 years. These truces were merely pauses in a single, prolonged war that continued until Russia achieved its goals.

This is important to take into account when understanding the historical specifics and when building any kind of strategy. Expecting that Russia will “grow tired” and retreat is a profoundly unhistorical forecast. Of course, history does include unique and unexpected cases — no one rules out the emergence of catastrophes or extraordinary events. But based on historical experience, this particular feature of Russian strategy deserves attention and respect.",@alexeys3926,2025-05-17T08:40:07Z,0.0

There are only 2 reasons why someone moves towards or away from something.  There is either more satisfaction to be had, such as the proverbial ""Greener grass on the other side of the fence,"" or staying in the same place results in enough pain and discomfort, such that one needs to move.  The latter is now the case with Russia.  That is why it will take a last full measure of economic sanctions and the continuation of support for Ukraine to make the Russian economy and Russian mothers want to move away from war.

That said, do you really believe Russia would accept any other terms from Ukraine and NATO other than it's own terms that they laid out in 2022 before Boris Johnson intervened and stopped Ukraine from negotiating? The reality is there's really no end to this war until Russia takes Odessa and landlocks western Ukraine and NATO because it will want total control of the black sea and every ship or sub tgat passes through there because that's their border and therefore a big security concern right now and in the future especially if a more hostile president replaces trump like Biden after Trump leaves office.

The reported attack comes just hours after Russia and Ukraine held their first direct peace talks since 2022 - no breakthrough was achieved, although a swap of prisoners of war was agreed.

Please, evacuate to Zion, the Church of God, before disaster comes.

You must listen to God's words and warnings.
If you keep the Passover, God will save you from any disasters.
You have to believe this.

The Spirit and the bride say, ""Come!"" And let him who hears say, ""Come!"" Whoever is thirsty, let him come, and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life.(Revelation 22:17)

Father Spirit and Mother bride have called you to come back to Zion, and come back to God's precepts, rules, and laws.

In the midst of frequent wars, various natural disasters, unpredictabile and sudden accidents, when you celebrate the P.A.S.S.O.V.E.R, the flesh and blood of Christ, Heavenly Father and Mother protect you from any disasters and prevent you from danger. Furthermore if you keep the Passover, you can live your daily life comfortably, hoping for an eternal kingdom of heaven without fear of disaster.
Have faith in Elohim God to protect you, and you can be protected from any danger if you come to Zion in the event of such a disaster.
If you always live a life worthy of going to heaven with a correct and pious life and a beautiful heart, our father, Ahn Sang-hong, and 
our heavenly mother will take care of you safely.

Listen to God's words in the church of true truth, the church of God, and the nearby Zion, which is done according to the Bible, and let's all meet in heaven without sadness or pain.

more edited music videos again lol
As of 2024, Russia occupies almost 20% of Ukraine and about 3 to 3.5 million Ukrainians are estimated to be living under occupation; since the invasion, the occupied territories lost roughly half of their population

Gen. Mark Milley  say ukriane lost two hundred thousand soldiers 200000
publish data on Ukrainian losses during the current conflict on January 14, 2023:

   1,157,000 dead
    234,000 injured
    27,230 in captivity,
    934 dead NATO instructors (USA and Great Britain),
    32,458 dead NATO servicemen (Germany, Poland, Lithuania, etc.)
    15,360 dead mercenaries.
but now in 2025 its more like 800000

Russia 
describes military doctrine as defensive military doctrine. With regard 
to nuclear weapons specifically, Russia reserves the right to use 
nuclear weapons: in response to the use of nuclear and other types of 
weapons of mass destruction against it or its allies,in case of 
aggression against Russia with the use of conventional weapons when the 
very existence of the state is threatened
How do Russian nuclear weapons compare to the rest of the world?

How do Russian nuclear weapons compare to the rest of the world?

1. We are ALL sinners - (Rom. 6:23) For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;









*Sin separates us from the Holy God









2. There is a punishment for our sin -(Rom. 6:23a) For the wages of sin is death;








* Death - eternal death - HELL









3. God loves us, He does not want us to go to Hell, He provided a way for our escape from Hell - (Rom. 5:8) But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.









* Because of God's love for us, He sent his only son Jesus Christ to die in our place on the cross. Jesus Christ took all the weight of our sins so we can be saved through grace, NOT our works.









* The blood that Jesus shed on the cross can wash away our sins and make us clean









4. Through Jesus Christ, we can now have eternal life in HEAVEN - (Rom. 6:23b) but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.









*Gift - free, but you can only have it if you receive it. If you reject it then the punishment of Hell is waiting for you









5. How can I receive eternal life? - (Rom. 10:9) That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 









* You have to admit you are a sinner and you cannot save yourself from Hell nor go to Heaven through your own efforts.








 You have to believe in your heart that Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins, was buried and rose again after 3 days and that He and only He can save you from hell.









(Roman 10:13) For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  









* Whosoever means anyone including me and you! 









Do you want to do it? Pray this prayer:









Dear God, I admit I am a sinner and cannot save myself from hell. I believe that Jesus Christ died for my sins, was buried and rose again. I believe that only  Jesus Christ can save me from Hell and He is the only way to Heaven.  I accept Jesus Christ in my heart as my Lord and Savior. Thank You for eternal life. Amen.

Mexicans in the region harbor no such illusions, nor are they unaware of the simple fact that the California Gold Rush began just weeks after the ignominious Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, while California was still under Mexican administration.

There is not one smidging of blood or dust, or dirt on those bus seats.
This is Zelensky try to get pity when he visits that fake pope’s Papal Inauguration today. Keep reading and I will explain.

How is leo xiv a fake pope.

Because dear St John warned us in Revelation 9 about the End Times war with the beast who sets himself up in the Church of God. 

St John never heard of electricity, or computers, so he used analogies using objects he was familiar with to warn us, like the humming & buzzing of locust that sounds like the buzzing of electricity. 

And scorpions tails that are like the sting of electrical wires.

The faces of men, with hair like women, wearing breastplates of hyacinth(purple) to describe women in drag wearing a man’s silicone breastplate disguise (using voice changing technology to change the frequency of voices).
Chic lay o, Peru.

This warning is for today.

St John even gave us the date that the last anti-pope would be elected,  and it remained hidden for 2000 years, right there in Holy Scripture, until it came to pass on the 8th of May, 2025.

Revelation 17:11 
“And the beast which was, and is not: the same is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into destruction”.

- And the beast which was(the beast a diabolical liar in disguise)
- and is not (is not a man, or a pope)
- the same is the eighth(the anti- pope elected on the 8th)
- and is of the seven( leo is the last of seven anti-popes since that illegitimate vatican ii regime revolt talked about in 2 Thessalonians 2: 3-4)
- and he shall go into destruction 

Revelation 13:8 
“And all that dwell upon the earth adored him, whose names are “not” written in the book of life of the lamb”.

“If any man have an ear, let him hear”.

6dUDjbvxpMA,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"The American Empire started this war and the Russian Federation will inevitably finish it. This 11 year conflict began when the CIA orchestrated a violent political coup which overthrew the democratically elected leader Victor Yanukovych and installed a US friendly illegitimate ultra nationalist regime with ties to far right paramilitaries such as the Azov Battalion and Svoboda in 2014. This coup split the country into a brutal civil war between the new US friendly government of Kiev and Donbas oblasts of Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea friendly to Moscow that didn't recognise the new regime, resulting in over 15,000 civilian casualties and 50,000 fleeing into Russia. President Poroshenko never honoured the Minsk peace accords that was brokered between Moscow and the EU and even former German chancellor Angela Merkel admitted in an interview that Minsk was just a stalling tactic to flood Ukraine full of NATO weaponry for their assault on the donbas but for something much more dangerous. To the Russians, they could never allow Ukraine to become a NATO member, but remain neutral. They would never allow the Crimean peninsula to be used by the US navy. This was always a red line for the Russians who always demanded Ukrainian neutrality for their national security concerns going back to the times of Baker and Gorbachev who agreed that NATO should never expand any further east of Germany regardlessof their security treaty with Ukraine. Obviously these treaties were broken due to aggressive NATO expansion  after the cold war. Even Putin in the early 2000s asked for NATO membership. After all NATO was created to counter the Soviet Union and the cold war ended, but Putin was refused because of the old NATO docturine, "" keep the US up, Germans down and the Russians out. "" If Russia was a member then what was the point of NATO continuing without a constant enemy and obviously the profits of the US military industrial complex aka the US economy. When the Kiev regime never honoured the Minsk accords and donbas autonomy, Donetsk and Luhansk became independent states and called for direct Russian military assistance. Zelensky campaigned on peace, but when he gained power he quickly realised that he had zero control over the Ukrainian military and the ultra nationalist paramilitaries fighting in the east. In fact these Azov forces publicly humiliated Zelensky and even Ukrainian commanders admitted in the Kiev Independent that they "" take their orders from Washington."" And even the paramilitaries were on the payroll of the CIA as revealed by the LA times. Zelensky tried to negotiate peace but even his diplomats were suspicious assassinated some believing by the SBU. And when he tried to negotiate a ceasefire in April 2022, the UK prime minister Boris Johnson personally flew to Kiev and scuttled the peace talks  negotiations mediated by Turkey and Israel, promising Zelensky what he couldn't deliver. Full NATO membership. Zelensky soon realised that he was just a puppet of the American Empire, a poster boy for NATO to turn Ukraine into Afghanistan 2.0 where the Ukrainians will be used a cannon fodder for the Washington neocon project of trying to destabilise Russia and eventually balkanise Russia into weaker demilitarised microstates ripe for western plunder. But mainly for war profits for the US military industrial complex. Wash money out of the NATO tax basis and into the hands of the transnational security elite. To the Russians this was a direct threat to their  national security. And given Putin the excuse to conduct the SMO and annex the regions constitutionally into the Russian Federation. The objectives was clear. Secure the donbas and Crimea and create a buffer zone and then demilitarise Ukraine of NATO. Ukraine now is a failed state. Zelensky is no longer president of Ukraine. His presidential constitutional term has expired back in May 2024 and since then he declared himself the unelected de-facto ruler of Ukraine, installed martial law, arrested the main opposition party leaders and banned 11 political parties. He has arrested journalists, banned several news media organisations and consolidated the rest into his own state media apparatus. He has allowed the ultra nationalists to run amok within the Ukrainian military and allowed his SBU to round up untrained men and throw them on the front lines at the Russian war machine. The most disturbing fact was he allowed the SBU to set up a international kill list website called Mirotvorec which targets dissenters to the war such as politicians, activists, journalists and musicians. And a CBS report collaboration with the WaPo and New York Times revealed how the Ukrainian military top brass were skimming NATO money and weaponry and selling it to the international illegal arms trade markets. 
This conflict has not only devastated Ukraine, but economically devastated the EU when the German government allowed the US military to directly destroy their own nord stream pipeline infrastructure with Russia in a sabotage operation revealed by pulitzer prize winner journalist Seymour Hersh, for American expensive LNG and refined Russian oil and gas via India. The Americans now have made their new minerals deal and Zelensky will pay tribute. Zelensky under orders of Trump is demanding Zelensky make peace now to secure those mineral rights as the Russian military is gaining ground every day at the expense of the Ukrainian people. At the end of the day Ukraine will split into two parts. One part will be owned by American kleptocrats and the other part will be owned by Russian kleptocrats. I dont know which will be worse. Ukraine is just another victim in a long line of victims of American imperialism and the US are desperate to wrap up this war they started, like in Syria, so they turn their neocon agenda to Iran and China.

The first war was World War II, when the Germans captured this region, she was 16 years old then and she studied at a technical school. She told me that then they were forced to bury the corpses. I did not ask her whose corpses they ordered and who forced them. I was afraid that her health would deteriorate. A couple of years ago, she was offered to move to a boarding school for the disabled in the city of Sumy, she refused and does not want to leave at all. Later, Russia struck a missile at this school for the disabled. Near her house there was an oak tree that was planted when she got married. The oak was about 80 years old, it was huge. A year ago, she made an agreement with someone and they cut it down. She was afraid that it would fall on the house and destroy the roof. It can fall on the house because of artillery. The border with Russia is 15 km away.  This city is regularly shelled. The post office is not working there now and many shops are closed.

The Russians have been running rampart in the Sumy region for... quite some time now, and there is a huge offensive coming up in a few days. Just evacuate the place and stop civilians from literally DYING. The Russians have the right to bomb every single ""supposed"" military target they can find and a bus filled with people... Like that is the most obvious military target that you can possibly think of, what if those ""civilians"" were Ukrainian soldiers instead? Or if there were a spy hiding inside the people? 



Just fkin evacuate the damn battlefield, goddamn it. These idiots are making me really mad like the Russians are literally announcing that they are coming to kill you, and if you ain't a soldier then GTFO of the way. To have a literal bus filled with civilians running around while drones are flying in the air is literally madness and stupidity.

Currently, Russia is working towards exhaustion. You will see that as soon as NATO stops sponsoring the war and leaves in disgrace, like from Afghanistan, the people of Ukraine will think about it, hold their presidential elections without US interference, and then peace will come, and the new Ukraine will become something like Belarus for Russia.

Putin, promised him that when the Ukraine will be controlled by Russia he will get the region which belong to Hungary before I World War. Recently Ukrainian counter intelligence arrested three Hungarian spies in that region! Former Polish ruling party PiS was in a very good cooperation with Orban. In the first week of invasion, Polish Prime Minister offered Ukrainians that Polish soldiers can enter western Ukraina to protect people living there they offer was rejected by Zelensky.

These “new” boundaries had existed before, and lasted a lot longer than the boundaries set up in 1991.  I am not saying this will happen, but there is precedent for those boundaries and the mixed ethnic makeup of those oblasts would potentially give those governments an ethnic nation state card to play, but also a tremendous risk of ethnic cleansing conflict.",@nutk1n,2025-05-16T00:29:06Z,0.0

[17] For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. [18] He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

HCLzN8Xprbk,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"Rush is not losing anything they can take all of you crazy they really wanted the problem is Russians and ukrainians are slaves, the same religion same culture so itt was never intent to annihilate Ukraine because of the same culture. However the problem is United States alliance called NATO they've used it to occupy countries because they're the ones that violated the terms not to expand NATO to President Gorbachev in March 8 1991 a written agreement that not one inch would expand East unfortunately they violated by pushing 14 countries into the NATO alliance which means that are all US military bases in those additional countries. Romania being on the border of Ukraine is United States is building the biggest military base and that's a conflict which borders Ukraine and that's a huge problem. The United States needs to leave your period because all this is becoming more and more imperial by lying to NATO countries to join the alliance and then they occupy them. It's reverse engineering of the Soviet Union that's why Russia retaliated because you cannot have this security threat by the United States into europe. So Rush is on the right side of History and they should take more territory of Ukraine because that's all the United States wants to do is they want to take Ukraine for their interest at the same time United States does not have any conflict in America with Canada and Mexico if China or Russia had military alliances in their backyard they were never accepted.

no territories for Poland
no territories for Romania
the whole point of ruzzian bolschewiks is to have MOUNTAINS on the western part of their country
ruzzians want to have a ""natural"" border in the west
Carpathian mountains work for this good
...
and the beginning of the war they wanted to:
1) change Ukraine's gov and put their pro-ruzzian one
2) annex southern part of Ukraine to have a land bridge to Crimea

HCLzN8Xprbk,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"Well, thanks to the US and Zelensky, Ukraine will have a very tiny population, so a tiny country would be appropriate. Trump and his son-in-law could make it into a casino resort for the degenerates who own the world. A sort of kinky new Switzerland.

Blackrock thinks it owns most of the land in what the West thinks of as Ukraine. And Trump thinks he owns its rare Earth metals and minerals, but Zelensky also sold that stuff to the UK and probably others.

And Zelensky had no right to sell anything. 

Folks need to stop joking around here. This map is not a Russian government
map, but it is a sensible one, allocating the oblasts essentially by their dominant ethnicities. The Russians will end up having to settle who gets what, because no one else is being honest and because Russians look after Russians. Putin will see to it that Russians (including Transnistria), Moldovans, and Hungarians have fuel, and he will have to landlocked the rump Ukrainian state to keep everyone safe. 

Trump can pretend to be a disinterested party, but the US started and has funded the conflict, and Trump missed his chance to dump the dirty project, so it is his war now and he has lost. 

The only reason the US is still squabbling is to protect BlackRock’s interest, which is what Trump did with the Panama Canal.

If Ukraine unconditionally surrendered right now, it would save many lives. It could probably keep the “Polish” section. Nobody wants those oblasts anyway.",@cyclonejane,2025-04-28T12:22:54Z,0.0
HCLzN8Xprbk,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"It would be nice to have Lviv in Poland again, but we will never go with Russia against Ukraine. If there was a possibility of buying Lviv back or, for example, exchanging it for Chełm or Przemyśl, Ukraine knows where to contact us. From the more distant areas of Ukraine, such as Volhynia, we only care about the bones of victims of massacres by Ukrainian nationalists, which we want to bury. We do not want these lands even if they paid us. It would be very convenient for Russia to antagonize Poles and Ukrainians against each other again, but we have already been through this. Despite my sentiment for Lviv, I would never want the Polish army to attack Ukraine. If it could be arranged diplomatically, then great, if not, then it should be respected and that's it.

Why would we dismantle Ukraine with Russia, which would then start to pressure us and vassalize us? This is nonsense, and we know Russia too well to go for it. And I am sure that the Romanians have the same approach. I do not say anything about the Hungarians because they and Slovakia are ridiculous countries. By the way, Slovakia is shouting very loudly for a country built from the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary. Maybe some partition should be done here? Despite personal dislike for Hungary, the fact is that our nations are friendly and a common border in Slovakia would be fine for us. It's funny that Slovakia is going with a country that has claims to their lands (Hungary).

I will also emphasize one thing. Russia offered us these territories after the collapse of communism and there was a sounding out of Poland whether it would go with Russia against Ukraine around 2009. We refused in both cases. I will not be false because yes, it would be nice to have Lviv in Poland, but only if there was such an option and Ukraine did it voluntarily through diplomacy. But if it meant antagonism between us again, then this is a price that is not worth it. Ukraine must be between us and Russia. And if they were to give us Lviv hypothetically, then it would be nice to have compensation, for example in Rostov-on-Don and those areas. And it is worth reminding the Muscovites that if they are so honorable and want to give us back our former territories, then let them let Belarus go free and give us and Lithuanians Królewiec for division and Smolensk. These were also our territories, so let them be consistent.",@azazeldemon7779,2025-04-28T11:18:55Z,0.0

Про то, что мы тратим все наши деньги на армию (в большей части - возможно. Хотя - мы развиваем и другие области, помимо военной).

Are they trying to turn it into some kind of Russian Orthodox Vatican or something? Kind of a cool idea but not really happy about all the bloodshed but I suppose all nations are forged from bloodshed and death, it was just so long ago nobody remembers or cares. I highly doubt this outcome will materialise, I don’t think nations like Poland, Romania and Hungary would be comfortable absorbing former Ukraine territory like this.

It's just absurd, especially since there are barely any Poles or Romanians living in these lands. Plus Russia likely wouldn't leave any Ukrainian state at all, it will just annex the whole thing and create a puppet republic that will be integrated with the russian federation.",@benq3009,2025-04-15T21:44:23Z,0.0

In 1939 USSR joined Germany to attack Poland. 2 years later Germany attacked Russia. That was a good lesson for us Poles.

John 3:16-21

16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. 18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. 19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. 20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. 21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.

Mark 1.15

15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.

2 Peter 3:9

The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

Hebrews 11:6

6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

3. In Chernovitsya, Rumanians are minority in every single rayon and almost non existant in the rest.

4. The only funny thing is that Little Russia will shrink to the Oblast of Kiev just to be liable of all the lians and debts acquired by the Comediant.

The shame is, this isn’t Ukraine’s fault. This country is caught up in the middle of a tug of war. Although overthrown and a western backed coup was installed to carry out aggressions towards Russia and host NATO to launch an attack inside Russian borders, Ukraine has a right to exist too. 
This is hardly a “buffer zone”’between Russia and NATO. In fact, it only brings more NATO states right up to Russia’s door step. 
And here Putin is saying he wants Ukraine to remain a “sovereign” state. I guess only a small fraction of it will be left for that idea. He failed to mention that part. Real slick!

6 years later ""green men"" with no visual nationality signs on uniforms annex Crimea and in 2022 Russia make full scale invasion shooting incendiaries and cluster bombs to civilian housing, hospitals and non-military targets. War crimes include among others manslaughter and children kidnapping.

HCLzN8Xprbk,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"Poland annexing any Ukrainian territory is something that is extremely hard to imagine. Recognizing Ukraine’s territory in full was practically an unquestionable foreign policy of any Polish government since the moment Poland become free from the Soviet control. The idea of relinquishing Poland’s claim over the Galicia and Volhynia, that were annexed into the Soviet Ukraine after the WWII, was thought out by the Polish emigres for, among other reasons, a way to settle the question of Poland’s Western borders that similarly moved to the West into the previously German-controlled territory after the war. No less importantly, Polish intellectuals saw a need to have a strong Ukraine as a way to counter a potential threat from Russia. (Look up Juliusz Mieroszewski and Jerzy Giedroyc)

From time to time one can read news about Ukraine and Poland arguing with each other about their shared history, I know that history does not like hypotheticals, but I think it is nothing in comparison to what these relations could have been without the Polish-Ukrainian reconciliation that has happened throughout the years. You got to remember that prior to that in the XX century the Polish-Ukrainian conflicts were brutal, there was an enormous amount of mutual animosity.",@D.S.handle,2024-05-11T14:54:22Z,0.0

The Russian soldier was injured and no threat, and should either be left alone, or taken prisoner, so k1lling him like that is a war crime under the Geneva convention.  They've 'finished off' many injured Russians like that - each one being a war crime.  Yes, I'm sure such crimes are being committed on both sides, but people should stop making out the Ukrainians are whiter than white.  They're not.  And 30:43 is another breach of the Geneva Convention - interviewing and broadcasting videos of POWs violates protections under the Geneva Conventions intended to ensure dignified treatment of captured combatants on all sides.",@TrueBrit1,2025-05-05T21:44:11Z,0.0

You people just follow the herd, and probably think the war began in 2022 in an ""invasion"". East Ukraine is Russian speaking, and has been under siege by Ukranian forces for years - for the CRIME OF SPEAKING RUSSIAN. What kind of country outlaws a language and punishes citizens who speak it, under threat of imprisonment and execution? Won't even get into Azov batllion and Right Sector. It just blows my mind. We shouldn't be supporting either side, but praying for peace. If you really care about the Ukranian people you would support an end to this warm and let the Russian speaking territories govern themselves, or join Russia if that's what they want. It is clearly the will of Dontesk and Lugansk to be in Russia, so why force them to be Ukranian? Crimea is a no brainer, they are Russian speaking Tatars, yet we have westerners saying ""Free Crimea"".

Stop spreading propoganda and deception, there is SO much deception about this conflict and you people are just hypnotized to it, and pick sides while dehumanizing the other. These are human beings. And you have zero memory about OUR role (as Americans)- If the State department and Biden/Obama admins would have just STAYED THE F*CK OUT of this country.. and left the situation alone, 1.5 million people would still be alive.

Please, evacuate to Zion, the Church of God, before disaster comes.

You must listen to God's words and warnings.
If you keep the Passover, God will save you from any disasters.
You have to believe this.

The Spirit and the bride say, ""Come!"" And let him who hears say, ""Come!"" Whoever is thirsty, let him come, and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life.(Revelation 22:17)

Father Spirit and Mother bride have called you to come back to Zion, and come back to God's precepts, rules, and laws.

In the midst of frequent wars, various natural disasters, unpredictabile and sudden accidents, when you celebrate the P.A.S.S.O.V.E.R, the flesh and blood of Christ, Heavenly Father and Mother protect you from any disasters and prevent you from danger. Furthermore if you keep the Passover, you can live your daily life comfortably, hoping for an eternal kingdom of heaven without fear of disaster.
Have faith in Elohim God to protect you, and you can be protected from any danger if you come to Zion in the event of such a disaster.
If you always live a life worthy of going to heaven with a correct and pious life and a beautiful heart, our father, Ahn Sang-hong, and 
our heavenly mother will take care of you safely.

Listen to God's words in the church of true truth, the church of God, and the nearby Zion, which is done according to the Bible, and let's all meet in heaven without sadness or pain.

mK7vxYdaIxU,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"When the war first started in2022, I knew that the Ukrainian people were going to kick some ass once I saw them filling up old beer bottles with gasoline to throw molotov cocktails at the invading Russian troops. And these were old men, women, and children in the city of Kyiv! Then, against the odds, they stopped Putin's line of tanks that he thought he'd just walk into the city with and take over easily. HA! The joke is on Putin! Every step of the way he has made old school blunders from Soviet era, using ancient tanks and not counting on the Ukrainian people to get smarter and smarter very fast.. the world is impressed with the Ukraine. Europe, the US, everyone is behind you! Here in my household we keep you in our prayers and pray for peace. We know you will eventually win, we just pray that it doesn't take Putin's dumb ass to take too long to realize that he's already lost, and that he will stop sacrificing soldiers to death like the Maya people did 500 years ago. I don't know how the leader of a country could be allowed to do that to his own people. Good luck to you all, and Godspeed.

And I just closely followed the laws that were passed in Ukraine and Russia. And as surprising as it may sound, the laws were absolutely identical, practically at the same time the presidents signed an amendment to the law on organ transplantation, making their citizens donors by default. Previously, a legally executed permit was required. They legalized the right of the state to restrict the civil rights of citizens, introduce bans on movement around the country and leaving the country, legalized strict censorship and much more. This is not a war, this is a common bloody business of the rulers of Ukraine and Russia. During the entire military action, not a single missile even flew close or fell near the castles of the oligarchs, the government, deputies and other ruling scum. In Ukraine, there is only one oil refinery, which belongs to the Jewish oligarch Kolomoysky.  If this plant had been bombed, the Ukrainian army would have had huge problems with fuel, but not a single missile even flew nearby or fell.",@massage_world,2025-04-30T05:38:15Z,2.0

To be honest, if Russia was not such a S**T HOLE of the world with so many poor people they would have run out of manpower 2 years ago.

mK7vxYdaIxU,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"That personnel anti drone cage is crazy.I just recently thought of something for FPV drones in particular for vehicles or tanks. It would basically be a bunch of long metal poles sticking out on the vehicle in all directions To make the drone detonate at a distance to help mitigate the Blast damage. Not sure how practical or effective that would be, but it’s just a thought. I guess it’s a similar concept to the nets or cages. I would call it the porcupine lol. Other ideas similar and concept Would be a bunch of nozzles Placed  around a vehicle that shoot a high pressure stream of water. So basically a bunch of water cannons. Or maybe just the one large water cannon at the top center of the vehicle on a turret system that can be operated by a soldier To deflect incoming drones. Another idea would be a bunch of tubes placed around a vehicle that shoot a large batch of metal balls. Or maybe just one single large gun, again placed on the top center with a turret system That shoots a similar projectile. I actually seen a video of a Russian buggy that used a similar device. It had a couple tubes placed on the front sides of the vehicle That shoot a bunch of metal balls straight up into the air.",@Sam-vh9zs,2025-04-28T03:39:06Z,2.0

PUTIN repite las políticas hitlerianas para ejecutar sus anexiones.violamdo el derecho internacional en forma descarada.

mK7vxYdaIxU,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"24:30  I don't think that's what happened there. 
It’s actually pretty standard for small team assault to use APCs, IFVs, or even tanks(*) to provide covering fire for their advance and then just seemingly abandoning the troops after they've dismounted and entered the position.
(*sometimes on bigger assaults they are just riding on top of the vehicle: funnily enough it's often seen on BTRs since it's really a death trap to stay in it because of the little amount armor, it's still used because of the stabed 30mm of the 82a or just when there's nothing else, from what i've seen ukraine doesn't use it much anymore an assault but more as a gun on wheels and other variants maybe for rotations since it's better than a pickup).

Anyway the reason the vehicules rarely stays is to not attract arty, drones or RPGs coming from others trenches, they'll usually retreat a few hundred meters waiting to be used for casevac.
It looks very dangerous and crude but the tactic let the vehicle suppress enemy positions during the rapid advance, and let the troops riding it dismount very close to trenches or strongpoints fairly safely. 

The “stranded infantry left behind after a vehicle is hit and retreat alone” yeah, it can happen, but what people often complain about is when a vehicle’s knocked out mid-assault and other vehicle accompanying the assault don't pick the stranded infantry up and justleave the area… but well, war’s messy.",@litare4328,2025-04-28T02:20:45Z,0.0

This is concerning. Also, I for one greatly appreciate the work you do to maintain your channel and show the clips you glean from Telegram. I've attempted to find these clips as well and I know just how much of a pain in the rear they are to find. I have an appreciation for this hard work. and I might consider the job you are offering but alas, I am not up to the task since I have a great deal of difficulty staying awake for extended periods of time  mostly due to my age, but I am also physically and mildly mentally disabled that would place me as an unsuitable candidate for the position you are looking to fill. But hang in there friend, you will eventually find someone to fill the position and give you a hand to lessen your work burden. You do an excellent job at it, since of most of the videos of the conflict I've seen, yours is the most coherent and is easily understandable. Keep up the fantastic work. I wish you all the best, since YouTube seems to be crashing down on most channels that are showing the war in Ukraine, as well as videos exposing the Chinese for the hypocrites they are, and showing their horrible behavior to the world. People like you are needed badly and if YouTube cracks down on your channel, I recommend Pepperbox as an alternative since they were started by people who have been constantly under attack from YouTube and I know you'd be welcomed there and would have much less restrictions on your content, if any at all, since the service does not support censorship but freedom to produce content that will not be edited for the ""delicate Snowflakes"" out there who cannot stand to see anything that might be considered offensive. thank you for showing the war the Ukrainians are fighting to maintain their freedom and gain their territory back.

mK7vxYdaIxU,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"The depth of your research is impressive. And you are the only channel showing both the Ukrainian side and the Russian side [that I don't support, just to be clear]. This is very rare those days so thank you for your efforts in providing a more balanced covering of the war, if only from tactical and strategic points of view. Some feedback about your video format: add more 'silent space', or visual 'breaks', between disconnected footage as it can be hard sometimes to realize that you've jumped to a different action. Also, in reference to 31:30 and as per the Third Geneva Convention of 1949, it is prohibited to ""expose POWs to public curiosity"". Exposure to public curiosity covers the simple disclosure of images of POWs and recordings of interrogations. Even if POWs appear to make voluntary public statements or willingly participate in the recording of images, disclosure to the public remains unlawful. Thus I would invite you to blur their faces and passport details should you wish to keep on showing them [full disclosure: I do find it interesting to see confirmation of Chinese and North Korean soldiers fighting for the Russian army].",@cafecybernz,2025-04-27T13:58:56Z,9.0

Please, evacuate to Zion, the Church of God, before disaster comes.

You must listen to God's words and warnings.
If you keep the Passover, God will save you from any disasters.
You have to believe this.

The Spirit and the bride say, ""Come!"" And let him who hears say, ""Come!"" Whoever is thirsty, let him come, and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life.(Revelation 22:17)

Father Spirit and Mother bride have called you to come back to Zion, and come back to God's precepts, rules, and laws.

In the midst of frequent wars, various natural disasters, unpredictabile and sudden accidents, when you celebrate the P.A.S.S.O.V.E.R, the flesh and blood of Christ, Heavenly Father and Mother protect you from any disasters and prevent you from danger. Furthermore if you keep the Passover, you can live your daily life comfortably, hoping for an eternal kingdom of heaven without fear of disaster.
Have faith in Elohim God to protect you, and you can be protected from any danger if you come to Zion in the event of such a disaster.
If you always live a life worthy of going to heaven with a correct and pious life and a beautiful heart, our father, Ahn Sang-hong, and 
our heavenly mother will take care of you safely.

Listen to God's words in the church of true truth, the church of God, and the nearby Zion, which is done according to the Bible, and let's all meet in heaven without sadness or pain.

Ej9QgA6HQYQ,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"On Europe's Role in the Current Conflict and Its Strategic Objectives

What is happening now is, at the very least, prolonging the duration of the conflict. Europe needs something entirely different. It is beneficial for France, Germany, and the United Kingdom that this conflict continues for some time, preferably involving Trump and turning the war into a kind of ""Trump's war."" This is the fundamental position of these countries.

It seemed that some progress was made along this path in April, but so far the progress remains incomplete.

Europe’s strategic objective is more global and even intuitive. In my opinion, Europe senses that in the transitional period from the old world of globalization to the new world of nation-states and civilizations, it is becoming something of a scapegoat. Europe is losing its geopolitical and geoeconomic influence, and the quality of life of its citizens is declining.

Against this backdrop, Europe is trying with all its might to cling to the old models of the world—often at the cost of Ukrainian lives. For Ukraine, the choice is significantly more difficult and painful.",@alexeys3926,2025-05-17T08:22:11Z,0.0

Matthew 24:6 reads: ""Then you will certainly hear of battles and next the sounds of battles being fought (this indicates that the current war in Ukraine will escalate). Be careful not to be afraid (this in turn indicates that this war will spread to other countries, escalating to a very dangerous form (with the use of tactical nuclear weapons; cf. Am 5:8,9) for everything must come to pass (meaning: to be fulfilled - Jesus here refers to Da 11:29a) but the fulfillment (implicitly: of the sign) is not yet there–this means that the U.S will not get directly involved in this war, and the strategic nuclear weapon will not be used yet.)""

Ej9QgA6HQYQ,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"BBC sounds like a propaganda mouthpiece from a Soviet playbook. It describes the root cause of the conflict as allegedly advanced by Russia to be the very existence of an independent Ukraine, which is clear misinformation. While the BBC is allowed to interpret positions as it pleases, this should be done in a different format—as political commentary, not as a news report. For reference, Russia has claimed the root cause to be Ukraine’s desire to join NATO and its treatment of the vast Russian-speaking population in Ukraine. Whether the BBC believes this to be the case or not is a different matter, but it is a travesty to distort what one side claims is its position into an editorial framing presented as the actual position.

Ej9QgA6HQYQ,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"What about the Russians just withdraw from Ukraine's borders, recognising those borders as they had previously signed up to do, providing solid security guarantees to continue to do so, as they had also already signed up to, receiving Ukraine's nuclear weapons as payment for that. And maybe they can also stop bleating about 'NATO expansion' going against what they were promised, when what they were promised in that regard was in the 2+4 treaty, is still there, and that promise from NATO has been upheld until this day. Also maybe they should recognise the right of any sovereign nation to form its alliances according to its own perception of its safety, when both Russia of course feels it has every right to do they same, and when all of those nations are smaller, have less weapons in many cases, even on occasion gave up their weapons to Russia, and have a long history of being invaded, controlled, absorbed, and oppressed by Russia. Maybe they'll also stop lying that Ukraine caused the violence in the Donbass and admit that it was them shelling from Russian territory, that it was they who sent in Russian warlords and militia in 2014, and that it was they who carried out acts of violence against the local population who disagreed and who fled WESTWARDS away from them, across the fighting lines, and walk the streets of Kyiv, Odessa, etc., etc., speaking Russian and completely unmolested, many of whom even are now in the Ukrainian defence forces again speaking Russian quite freely as they do so, while Russia lies that you will get attacked on the streets of Kyiv for speaking Russian.

America knows very well that Pakistan won't going to return the money. America knows very well that Pakistan will strengthen Terrorism and China. Pakistan has/had successfully fool World and America many times. Or maybe America is partner in crime. Or America thinks that Pakistan will buy Weapons from America and it will benifits Weapons Manufacturing companies. 

Pakistan will probably use the money against India, Balochistan, Isreal, Britain and Afghanistan. 

Why Britain? Britain has very high Pakistani Immigrant. Pakistanis sees Britain as Muslim majority country with Pakistani influence in future. Britain has probably highest numbers of Pakistani Sleeper cells. Entire Europe has very low population growth and Europe has been highly dependent on Muslim Immigrant. Many Politician has already fall trap into dirty game. Entire Europe is under threat, they failed to maintain a healthy management of Human Resource 

Isreal: Hatred against Isreal and India gives Electoral benifits in Pakistan. Action against Isreal gives hero status for Pakistani Army and its terrorist ecosystem. 

China: China is one of the most Irresponsible and dangerous country in the World. It's alleged that China uses Pakistan to disturb India and China uses North Korea to disturb Japan and South Korea. It's alleged that both Pakistan and North Korea gets Nuclear Weapon Technology and Missile Technology from China. Many countries with higher education and higher economic stability failed to develop Nuclear Weapon Technology but both Pakistan and North Korea gets it from Irresponsible and mentally unstable China. Both Pakistan and North Korea share border with China. China doesn't directly attack other countries as it will impect trade relationship so they are choosing mentally unstable countries who can act as per China's directive. Not only Pakistan and North Korea, they are targeting lots of other countries like Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Maldives, some African countries etc. 

America: America has obsessed with Weapons. In America more people died on their own Citizen then terrorist attack. It's alleged that America and some other Weapon manufacturing countries are one of biggest contributors of Terrorism. Terrorist don't have Arms manufacturing units. There are very few illegal Arms manufacturing units in the World. It's tough to kill each and every terrorist but its easy to locate Arms manufacturing units and destroy it. Arms manufacturing units needs high Vehicle movement, lots of supplier, bigger manufacturing space. Yes there are smaller Arms manufacturing units but they can't fulfill demand of World Terrorism or Criminal Industry. Most UN security Council members fool people on World's peace?

People should rise up and stop IMF aid to Pakistan otherwise ready to face Terrorism? In future all 5 continents might see Islamic aggression. Yes some people might term it as Islamophobia to divert reality but Sadly it is reality? If Muslim population increase in Europe and America, people will see ground reality.",@thepoliticalawareness1021,2025-05-16T12:16:20Z,0.0

Ej9QgA6HQYQ,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"They were there before in March 2022. No? UK's Boris Johnson rolled it then. 
There have been several rounds of peace talks to end the Russian invasion of Ukraine since it began in February 2022. Russia's president Vladimir Putin seeks recognition of all occupied land as Russian, for Russia to be given all of the regions it claims but does not fully control, guarantees that Ukraine will never join NATO, and the lifting of sanctions against Russia. Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy seeks a full withdrawal of Russian troops, the return of prisoners and kidnapped Ukrainian children, prosecution of Russian leaders for war crimes, and security guarantees to prevent further Russian aggression.
The first meeting between Russian and Ukrainian officials took place four days after the invasion began, on 28 February 2022, in Belarus, and concluded without result. Later rounds of talks took place in March 2022 on the Belarus–Ukraine border and in Antalya, Turkey. Negotiations in Turkey created an agreement in which Ukraine would abandon plans to join NATO and have limits placed on its military, while having security guarantees from Western countries, and not being required to recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea. The draft treaty was almost agreed to, but disagreements over security guarantees and the Bucha massacre ultimately halted negotiations.",@alexlong3714,2025-05-16T10:03:35Z,0.0

xQao6l_y714,Ukraine Is Using Robot Attack Dogs Against Russia | War on Tape | Daily Mail,"It looks like something out of science fiction but is in fact terrifyingly real - a robot dog being used by the Ukrainians to help fight the Russians. The Khartiia Brigade, which considers itself a model unit for the future Ukrainian army, has employed the dog on combat missions as a scout, using it to navigate minefields and map enemy trenches. 

But this is just the beginning - already, some people are experimenting with attaching weapons to it, and integrating AI would allow the dog to identify and attack its own targets. Which begs the question: Is this the future of war? Allow War on Tape to explain.

I can't see this having a big or any advantage over a very small and light fpv or autonomous drone. Maybe the occasional CTR tasks? Or deployed with a sensor and left for a few days for recce.

xQao6l_y714,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"Regardless of this Geopolitical mess, Ukraine continues to show impressive levels of innovation. They've Adapted & possess a crazy level of Ingenuity. They've developed their own Drone & Robotic technology from the ground up. The fact Ukraine has been able to successfully hold off this Russian invasion at all, is a WIN in my book. They destroyed a large percent of Russia's navy, even tho Ukraine doesn't have a Navy, That's a Win in my book! They are dedicated to protecting their homeland from this invasion. Ukrainians have my utmost respect.

It's always been a dream of Russia to weaken America from the inside. From Russia's perspective all of that internal instability makes Democracy's & Capitalism look like a complete Joke and a Broken Mess of a System.
All of this internal instability has to be making Putin so happy. Russia now has a US administration that is actually full on sympathetic towards Russia. 
America & our allies used to have die hard mindsets such as: ""If Russia invaded another country & started bombing civilians & destroying their cities"" We would have ZERO HESITATION about handling that with violence & force! Yet this current administration seems to no longer share the same core values that America has always stood for. This level of depravity Russia has committed these last years is horrifying. The world cannot let Russia continue to do this. They've committed a disgusting amount of Atrocities. Daily War crimes. Daily Bombing of Ukrainian cities. They blatantly target civilians. The world must punish Russia. We aren't seeing any of this covered in the news here in America? I'm absolutely ashamed of the way my country has behaved. This current administration has betrayed Ukraine and It makes me sick. 
I'm just glad that you are covering what you are because none of this gets any coverage here in the US news channels anymore. It's so messed up. This is such an important conflict yet our governments administration has basically made it vanish here in America. Ukraine is defending their homeland from an unprovoked Russian invasion. Events like this are exactly why organizations like NATO & the UN & the EU even exist. So why are they not doing anything. They can't just let Russia continue to act like this.. 
 This is the most intense conflict that has occurred on European soil since WW2.",@benmcreynolds8581,2025-05-14T23:30:36Z,50.0

This was due to a variety of factors including a much smaller military, economy, and less advanced equipment than what the Russian military initially possessed. But Ukraine proved the world wrong.

It's an early access, that will take a good amount of time to get polished and made into what all of you believe it can be. What I am getting on is- people do not take responsibility for their actions and think they get a free pass on assaulting people just because they can post it only. Do not let that get to you.

k7WHP9UPq24,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"This information reflects a subjective perspective.
To look at it from another window:
The USA and England signaled that Ukraine could be admitted to Nato. In the face of Russia's increasing attacks, Ukraine never thought of establishing a bargaining table with Russia. Because the USA and the UK said that they would provide unlimited military ammunition and material support to Ukraine in case of war.

But 1 year after the war started, the USA cut off aid. Because the U.S. Congress wanted it that way. After encouraging Ukraine to go to war, the USA's response to Ukraine at a time when military ammunition was most needed was ""the shop is closed""!!
Although it is claimed that a lot of aid has been provided, this does not reflect the truth. The only most important aid that works is Patriot missiles. The weapons sent by many EU member countries are scrap and garbage!! Some EU countries, such as Greece, Bulgaria, etc., which have old Soviet-made weapons and equipment in their inventories, sent ammunition and weapons to Ukraine that were expired, had no military value and had to be destroyed and removed from the inventory. Currently, Ukraine has turned into a dump with hundreds of types of old weapons and ammunition that have lost their destructive power.
There are a few major countries that currently send weapons.
Even though it has been 2 years since the war started, there are no F-16s yet!!
Germany refuses to provide missile aid with the excuse that its range is 500 km. Because he is worried that Ukraine may attack Russian cities with those missiles.
Europe's monetary aid is generally used to pay salaries and for civilian needs. Some useful weapons aid loses its meaning because it is not provided on time.
These people are in the middle of a war. In the harsh winter of Eastern Europe, they are trying to hunt the enemy, wrapped in the icy iron of machine guns. They are about to run out of ammunition. There is a war full of empty promises and so-called supporters who cannot find 155 mm artillery shells.
Biden cannot send the weapons he promised because he could not convince a few Republican senators!! Germany does not send missiles because it is afraid of Russia. The weapon containers that many countries boast about in the media are outdated inventory residues from the cold war period...!

There was no need for Ukraine to join NATO in the first place, NATO just wants to get into the Ukrainian land so U.S. can put defenses there to tighten up Russian borders. Think of it this way, do you see any Russian forces on the borders of U.S.?(nope) Do you see any enemies of U.S. nearby the U.S. borders? (nope) Do you think it will upset U.S. if Mexico suddenly become parts of China or Russia?(yes) So yeah that's basically how Russia feels towards Ukraine.",@xGinZero,2024-03-18T06:00:40Z,0.0

k7WHP9UPq24,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"From Author David Sacks:

“A WAR OF LIES

The war in Ukraine is based on lies — lies about how it started, how it’s going, and how it will end. 

We are told that Ukraine is winning when in fact it is losing. We are told that the war makes NATO stronger when in fact it is depleting it. We are told that Ukraine’s biggest problem is a lack of funds from the U.S. Congress when in fact the West can’t produce enough ammunition — a problem that will take years to fix. We are told that Russia is suffering greater casualties when in fact Ukraine is running out of soldiers — another problem money can’t fix. 

We are told that the world is with us when in fact the Global Majority believes U.S. policy is the height of folly. We are told that there is no opportunity to make peace when in fact we have rejected multiple opportunities for a negotiated settlement. We are told that if Ukraine keeps fighting, it will improve its negotiating position when in fact the terms will only get much worse than what was already available and rejected.

Nevertheless the lies will succeed in dragging out the war. Congress will appropriate more funds. Russia will take more territory. Ukraine will mobilize more young men and women to feed into the meat grinder. Discontent will mount. Eventually there will be a crisis in Kiev and the Zelensky government will be toppled. 

And then, when the war is finally lost, when the whole country lays in smoldering ruins on a funeral pyre of their own making, the liars will say “well we tried.” Having prevented any alternative, having smeared anyone who told the truth as puppets for the enemy, the liars will say “We did our best. We stood up to Putin.” 

In fact, they will claim, we would have succeeded but for the fifth column of Putin apologists who stabbed the Ukrainians in the back. Then, having shifted blame and patted themselves on the back, they will blithely move on to the next war, as they moved onto Ukraine after their disasters in Afghanistan and Iraq. 

The lies are comprehensive — but they will work.”

However, the world should remember that we have been in a desperate need of the promised artillery missiles for the past 3 months and that is getting terrible. 

the video definitely gives the right idea of huge loses and main features of the combat actions, but I can feel the inaccuracy in details. thank you for keeping this topic alive, though. it is vital for my nation to be seen now.

k7WHP9UPq24,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"Last summer, ukrainians attempted a counter-offensive against air superiority from russia, wich made it very difficult. For the next counter offensive, ukraine will have f-16s to both contest air superiority to russia and provide air support to ground units, so it should be less difficult to push through russian trenches. If a hole is made into russian defense, ukraine should send through fast vehicles, such as amx-10 and APCs, and fight behind the russian line; it should force russians to moove backward to keep cohesion. If Ukraine takes Tokmak, it should become possible to establish fire control over russian logistical lines with himars. Then, Ukraine will perhaps need time to take back the whole ot kherson region and Crimea, but it should be possible to achieve. Howether, it is possible for Ukraine to chose other ways. Anyway, the f-16 should change the situation in favor to Ukraine.
Also, the way Russia fights is heavily based on attrition, but it exposes Russia to attrition too. If Ukraine cares the lives of its soldiers and adapts its tactics, against russias attritional way, it should favor Ukraine as it will have less attrition on its side, wich should free a small mass of manoeuvre.",@gregoirelenoel507,2024-02-27T17:43:22Z,0.0

k7WHP9UPq24,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"The bottomline is - Russia started the war with 1:2 ratio (half the size of the Ukrainian army), and now has a 2:1 ratio. They also saved their aviation so they can be more active today.
Russia is back to the WWII strategy - overwhelming strength. More artillery, more bombs, more tanks, more men in general. Now all they have to follow is Zhukov's strategy - concentrate in one point like 10:1, break through, exploit it, and move into another key point. They have done it in Bakhmut, and now in Avdiivka, and they're planning to do the same in at least 4 different points just this spring.
Whatever Ukraine is doing, it won't be enough. The US stopping to supply more shells will just speed up the collapse. Russia can sustain this war basically forever, or at least for 10-15 years.
So yeah, unless someone has another gamechanger idea, Ukraine will fall. And then the Baltics, probably with minimal fighting, and then Moldova, Romania, Poland, Slovakia, and so on. NATO is strong together - but the member states each have a ridiculously small army. So if Russia can stop interference, for example with nuclear threats (or the actual use of nuclear weapons), then it can realistically conquer at least the Cold War Soviet hegemony.",@BladeTheWatcher,2024-02-27T09:56:06Z,2.0

At some point, Putin will go away. Then, there will be a bunch of gnashing of teeth but, the Russians will withdraw from Ukrainian territory perhaps holding some symbolic something...To ease the butthurt.

One thing is for sure, there is no easy from now till then, every nation, especially the US needs to support Ukraine to the utmost of it's abilities.

Putin's major goal, which has currently escaped him, regaining the glory of the fallen USSR and honestly, there is dementia at work, because that time is done.

It's like Mussolini attempting to recreate the Roman Empire...Not realistic and ultimately self defeating and ridiculous.

Millions upon millions will continue to suffer,the economy and the defence of both the countries will be in ruins also not to forget certain western nations are headed towards an economic crisis..The people will suffer,the government in Ukraine may or may not change for the time being but Putin will continue as the president/dictator of Russia and they'll just become arch rivals by spending billions n billions of euros to strengthen their borders..Families will be ruined, countries will be ruined, might as well see some leaders getting murdered..So all in all nobody wins nothing except for humanity loses almost everything..People lose everything..Nobody in the entire world get what they actually want n deserve which is peace..So to quote a great man i say..

In ten to fifteen years I expect to have to sadly learn about all the evil secrets about Ukraine or whatever 

However, if WW2 taught me anything, it's that it's very hard to hate winners and very easy to hate losers 

No matter what they ever declassify or just hits the internet and takes a while to be accepted by everyone, 

It remains factual that Russia will never live down going from the 2nd largest army in the world to the 2nd largest army in Ukraine

k7WHP9UPq24,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"where did you get the numbers for the ukraine aid from? Because from the normal reports this doesn't seem even remotely accurate and vastly overstated (hundreds of millions of small arms rounds, millions of artillery shells, hundreds of thousands of missiles).

also, the claim of ukraine having the best Air defense network in the world is pure and utter nonsense. they have less than 10 batteries of western-supplied air defense combined.

Also, the amount of MODERN western tanks supplied to ukraine is pretty low. not even 150 Leopard 2, Challenger 2 and M1 Abrams, Stridsvagn (with abrams never being seen in actual combat) combined.

k7WHP9UPq24,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"Support for Ukraine is one of the most worthwhile things the US government could be spending money. What about the border, you say? … funny enough there was a bill a few weeks ago that would have funded both, and at the last minute we decided to fund neither. Smh allowing the overrunning of this country _and_ Ukraine. 

It weakens America to not support Ukraine. Ukraine was in the legitimate process of becoming a US ally. They were invaded because of it. What message does it send to the world if we don’t help them? It sends the message: do not partner with the US, do not ally with the US, do not even think about it, because you will risk your own security and the us will do nothing

And it’s such a bs cop out — downright dishonest actually, and at best ignorant — to pretend you care about “my tax dollars going to Ukraine.” No taxes have been raised due to Ukraine, the money comes from the staggeringly large defense budget which is already earmarked for such things and aid for Ukraine represents mere pennies out of that. Additionally, giving old planes and bombs and stuff like that to Ukraine costs us nothing and frees up cash for improvements to our own military, which is why Trump and now Biden have both done this. 


I long for the day when Republican presidents like Ronald Reagan understood that projecting strength abroad and defending allies and diplomatic partners _is putting America first_ … we didn’t become a superpower because of magic.

Avdiivka has been critical politically for Putin because of the upcoming Russian 'elections'. This is already a week out of date because Ukraine withdrew from there in order to minimise casualties from the Russian strategy of 'meat wave' attacks and the urban warfare casualties that would have been unavoidable.

Also the difference in strategy? Russia, with a superior quantity, but less accurate missiles, illegally targeting civilian populations including schools, hospitals and power stations, grain silos and infrastructure etc, versus Ukraine's more accurate striking of military targets? 

What about the prevention of a Ukrainian attack against a valid Russian military target by Elon Musk? An unprecedented interference by an individual and private company in a war between 2 nation states.

Russian military has a history of targeting civilians, as proven in Syria when they helped the dictator Assad.

Lastly, the main reason that Ukraine has only made limited gains over the last year is because the US has not provided a fraction of what is required to do anything more than defend. As soon as the house of representatives in America gets sorted out, Ukraine will hopefully get the help it needs to expel the Russian aggressors.

When you look at the Vietnam War

expanded the war, when I received

draftees in the Vietnam War US,
were poorer, less educated and
minorities.
Since the draft ended in 1973, the

1% of the US population volunteer,
such since 9/11, and much of the

For example, Germany in WW2 loss over 34% of its military man power up to the point of Stalingrad and started loosing the war since that point. If at 34% Germany was able to fight on til 1945 and still loose it would be statistically impossible at an 87% for any military to muster forces even less conduct any form of training to replace losses. 
Bottom line is this is just not accurate although Russia has loss a lot of men the fact is Russia’s military is still alive and functioning even away from the front line. 
Ukraine, on the other hand is not able to replace its losses and each loss is now precious to them. Ukraine is going to need assistance and intervention at some point if it wishes to fight on .",@ES-je3em,2024-02-25T20:31:56Z,6.0

mguPodqxKRs,,,,,,,,,,,comment,"Kyiv must now take a courageous and realistic stance. 

The carrot that existed before the war began is no longer the same. Ukraine's entry into the European Union requires infrastructure that will operate for at least 15 years. However, for Ukraine to join NATO, NATO has changed, and it is almost impossible for Ukraine to join. Now, Kyiv must take the flexible initiative.

A month earlier, Beria had sent a letter to the Politburo, the governing body of the Soviet Union. In it he proposed the secret shooting of more than 25,000 prisoners of war, mostly from Poland, without any trial. These people are ""declared and hopeless enemies of Soviet power,"" Beria wrote. The Politburo headed by Joseph Stalin endorsed the proposal in writing on March 5 of that year. Almost 22,000 Poles fell victim to the mass murder over the next six weeks. Most of them were shot in the neck and their bodies were buried in previously dug mass graves. More than 4,000 prisoners were murdered in the Katyń Forest near the city of Smolensk (now Russia), and everyone else in at least four other locations, including Pjatikhatki near the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkov and Kuropaty near Minsk. The NKVD commanders of the individual POW camps had all the personal files of the murdered destroyed. The beasts then as now criminals against humanity.",@norbertmuller3979,2022-11-30T20:30:36Z,1.0
