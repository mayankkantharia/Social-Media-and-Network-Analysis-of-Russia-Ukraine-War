lW4h7aXNNR8,Russia reactivates Cold War bases - right on Nato's border,"Almost a million Russian personnel are estimated to have been killed, captured or wounded fighting in Ukraine and Kursk.

But despite those staggering losses, Russian president Vladimir Putin is still likely to have a bigger military when this conflict ends than when it began.

And there are indications that Moscow is already preparing its post-war posture, with signs that Russia is beefing up its military presence along its western border.

https://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1 - SUBSCRIBE TO US!
Attacks on Russia from the Armed Forces continue. Only for today's night in the sky above the Russian Air Force destroyed more than a hundred unmanned aerial vehicles. Details about this have been reported to the Ministry of Defense.

«Over the night 127 Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles of the aircraft type were intercepted and destroyed by air defense units on duty"", — says the message of the Telegram channel of the Ministry of Defense.

Ukraine directed its main attack at the Oryol region. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, 53 unmanned aircraft-type aerial vehicles were destroyed in the skies over the Oryol region.

The attack continued all night, and the last 16 drones were shot down in the morning, around eight o'clock Moscow time. There were no reports of casualties or deaths at the time of publication. The region's governor, Andrei Klychkov, said on his Telegram channel that the aftermath of the attack on the ground was being clarified. Drones attacked the Bolkhov factory of semiconductor devices in the Oryol region of the Russian Federation. Photos from the scene of the accident are spreading on social networks: they show a fire and a column of black smoke.

According to the Russian Telegram-channels, the company is connected with the military industry and produces components for radio-electronic equipment, including communication systems, control systems, EW, as well as simulators for tanks and missile complexes.

The plant's products are used by the defense concern ""Sozvezdie"" and other structures of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Six UAVs were intercepted and destroyed by electronic warfare and air defense systems in the Moscow region, three over the territory of the Ryazan region, one each in the skies of the Tula and Kaluga regions, and also over the waters of the Black Sea.

The border regions of Russia were also attacked. The most massive strike of the Ukrainian Armed Forces was in the Bryansk region. The Russian Ministry of Defense reported 51 drones destroyed over the Bryansk region. 36 UAVs were shot down over the Kursk region, and one over the Belgorod region.

The total number of Ukrainian drones destroyed over Russian regions on May 21 increased by 08:00 Moscow time from 127 to 159 units. No drones were spotted in the Samara Region at the time of publication. The threat of attack regime declared at night remains in effect.

He acknowledged the continued challenges in the border area and announced extended financial support for affected residents. Meanwhile, drone footage released by Russia shows a missile strike on a Ukrainian training camp in Sumy, reportedly killing six, though Moscow claims much higher casualties. Amid the escalation, Ukrainian President Zelensky has signaled readiness to meet Putin directly, following calls with U.S. President Trump, though no major progress has been made toward a ceasefire.

Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump declared, “This is not my war,” signaling a potential shift in U.S. involvement in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

f3KLL6kdrYw,Russian Defeat LOOMS in Ukraine... Putin CAN’T ESCAPE This TIME!,"On May 19, Foreign Policy detailed why experts now believe Russia is on the brink of defeat in Ukraine. Since the February 2022 invasion, Russia has lost nearly 976,000 troops to death, injury, or capture and over 10,800 tanks. Territorial gains have declined steadily, with only 55–78 square miles claimed in March 2025.

Compounding these losses is a stagnating Russian economy, with inflation nearing 10% and labor shortages projected to reach 2.4 million workers by 2030. Politically, Putin faces growing pressure as ceasefire negotiations stall and public dissatisfaction rises. As Ukraine begins counter-offensives, experts suggest Russia’s campaign is not just faltering — it may be nearing collapse.

z8b9G-xiQy0,Ukrainian warplanes break through Russian defense systems along the frontline,"#Kanal13​ #likekanal13​ #subscribekanal13 #warinukraine
https://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1 - SUBSCRIBE TO US!
The strike of the Ukrainian Su-27 fighter on the Russian command post in Lisichansk means that the pilots managed to successfully break through the dense air defense of the enemy in the occupied territory. This opinion  was expressed on air by the reserve colonel of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, pilot-instructor Roman Svitan on Channel 24 .
""Lisichansk is a long way off. That is, by and large, since our planes have started approaching there, it means that we have already pulled up a certain air defense system there, which covers the Su. Lisichansk is in the direction of Belogorovka. Lisichansk, Lisichansk Oil Refinery, Seversk..."", - said Svitan.
He suggested that the Ukrainian Armed Forces could have targeted the command post, for example, with HIMARS missiles.
""The fact that they have already started to approach there means that our Air Force is finally getting its wings and is already moving towards such serious areas - where the Russians have very strong air defense... They have been developing an air defense system in the occupied Donbass for 10-11 years. It is very difficult to approach there by planes..."", the expert emphasized.
According to him, the geographical features of the region are also important, in particular, the mountains, 300-350 meters high, which give the enemy's anti-aircraft missile systems and other corresponding weapons additional capabilities.
İt should be noted that Ukrainian warplanes break through Russian defense systems along the frontline.  Ukrainian fighter jets also play a key role in destroying Russian ballistic missiles and drones. A series of Russian ballistic missile attacks on Ukrainian cities have killed dozens of civilians in recent weeks, shaking an already uneasy sense of safety for Ukrainians living far from the front lines.
The Russian strikes are growing more lethal as foreign air defense aid to Ukraine has dwindled, particularly deliveries of Patriot missiles. Ukraine is left struggling to cover the shortfall.
Ukraine’s ability to shoot down inbound Russian drones and cruise missiles has grown enormously since Russia’s full-scale invasion. But despite ingenuity in domestic weapon production over the past three years, Ukraine has no homemade equivalent to the Patriot, a U.S.-made surface-to-air missile system whose latest iterations are uniquely good at stopping ballistic missiles in flight.
Ukraine’s local missile makers are working through a long list of demands on their production, while also finding their factories under frequent Russian aerial strikes.

VHnSt1OmXFQ,Russia launching WWII-style breakthrough in Sumy; Ukrainian snipers mass-kill Russian soldiers here,"#Kanal13​ #likekanal13​ #subscribekanal13 #warinukraine
https://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1 - SUBSCRIBE TO US!
Viktor Bobyrenko, an analyst at the Bureau of Policy and Analysis of Ukraine, believes that the landscape of the Sumy region and the nature of modern warfare will prevent Russian forces from breaking through Ukrainian defenses.
""To avoid sparking panic, let me say right away — a large-scale breakthrough in the style of World War II is not possible in Sumy. People here remember 2022, when Russia advanced and was, so to speak, on the outskirts of Sumy by midday. By February 25, the city was sealed off and under siege for a month. Today, there will be no such breakthrough where the enemy reaches Sumy in a day. Warfare is different now.
It’s simply not feasible because the terrain between the Siverskyi Donets and Psel rivers is not suited for tanks — it’s full of floodplains and a network of ponds. You can’t maneuver tanks there. However, it’s a paradise for sabotage and reconnaissance groups and snipers: a landscape with forests and woodlands, the edge of the Central Russian highlands,"" the analyst explained on Espreso TV.
According to him, Russian forces might try to use this area as a ""gray zone,"" given reports that Russia has amassed over 60,000 troops nearby. So there could be engagements similar to those near Pokrovsk — advances of maybe 500 meters a day at most. At that pace, it would take them six months to a year to reach Sumy. Therefore, there's no reason to panic about a rapid breakthrough in the region.
""Still, Russian artillery can strike up to 20 kilometers deep, as seen in Bilopillia, and FPV drones are active. For instance, on May 17, a minivan was hit by Russian forces just 11 km from the front line on the Sumy–Bilopillia–Putyvl–Hlukhiv–Shostka highway. The railway is nearby too. When a train runs from Sumy to Konotop, it speeds up to pass through this high-risk zone near the border. It’s possible the Russians aim to cut this road, which connects Sumy with communities north of the Siverskyi Donets River. In that sense, they could advance here.
But back in 1943, the Red Army advanced elsewhere — around the Pysarivka community, aiming to reach the rear of Kharkiv and sever the Sumy–Kharkiv highway and rail links. That area lies further south than where the current intense fighting is happening,"" Bobyrenko concluded.
